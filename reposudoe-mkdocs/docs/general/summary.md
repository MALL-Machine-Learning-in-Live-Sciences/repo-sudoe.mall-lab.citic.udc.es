# Summary

Currently, the development of new drugs faces high rates of failure, costs, and delays. This justifies the emergence of drug repurposing, allowing for new therapeutic indications for drugs already available on the market, benefiting the pharmaceutical industry, society, and patients.

The RePo-SUDOE project aims to develop and disseminate technologies for drug repurposing to increase the competitiveness of the SUDOE area in this R&D field, boosting the biopharmaceutical industry and attracting skilled human resources.

This objective will be achieved through three specific goals:

1. Expand scientific knowledge and disseminate technology for drug repurposing alongside public and private entities, elevating the R&D groups and centers in the SUDOE area to the European level of excellence in this R&D field.

2. Enhance multidisciplinary collaboration and identify innovative opportunities and initiatives in the SUDOE territory for drug repurposing, through the implementation of a transnational network. A database will be created with information on therapeutic targets and drugs with biological activity. As a main case study, drug repurposing methodologies for cancer treatment will be developed.

3. Create a prototype three-dimensional (3D) visualization room for biological systems, which will function as a pilot within the SUDOE territory. It will be a space with virtual reality and augmented reality technology that allows for the 3D visualization of therapeutic targets and their interaction with drugs, in an interactive and educational manner, dedicated to young students and researchers in STEAM fields.

This project brings together, for the first time, partners from different SUDOE regions and various areas of the drug development value chain, in a common project for drug repurposing. RePo-SUDOE will provide society with easily accessible scientific information and open access, as well as visualization technologies that are crucial for affirming the drug repurposing field within the SUDOE area.
