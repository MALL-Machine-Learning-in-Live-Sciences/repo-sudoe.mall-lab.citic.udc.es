# Drugs

As the project progresses, the identification of therapeutic targets and drugs of special interest ensures that efforts are streamlined, focused, and impactful.

Identification Process: A structured process will be established to identify therapeutic targets and drugs. This will involve a literature review, data analysis, and contributions from specialists in the field. A committee composed of all beneficiaries will oversee this process, ensuring a balanced and comprehensive approach. As a starting point, the YAP/TAZ-TEAD complex (a key component of the Hippo pathway, involved in the regulation of organ size and considered a cancer suppressor) will be used as a therapeutic target for cancer treatment. There are at least two patented molecules for activity in the YAP/TAZ-TEAD complex, highlighting the plausibility of this target for drug repurposing.

Integration with GT2: The identified therapeutic targets and drugs will directly feed into the actions of GT2. By defining these elements from the outset, it is ensured that subsequent efforts are well-directed and optimized.

Engagement with External Experts: Recognizing that the field of drug repurposing is broad and constantly evolving, external experts will be consulted during the identification process. Their knowledge will help to identify emerging trends, challenges, and areas of unmet need.

Documentation and Sharing: Once identified, the therapeutic targets and drugs of interest will be thoroughly documented. This information will be shared with all stakeholders in the project, ensuring transparency and collective understanding of the scientific rationale, potential applications, and strategic importance of these selections. Furthermore, these findings will be made available on the RePo-SUDOE platform, promoting greater awareness and potential collaborations.

## Cetuximab

**Description:**

Cetuximab is a recombinant chimeric human/mouse IgG1 monoclonal antibody that competitively binds to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and competitively inhibits the binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF). EGFR is a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases found in both normal and tumour cells; it is responsible for regulating epithelial tissue development and homeostasis. EGFR has been implicated in various types of cancer, as it is often overexpressed in malignant cells  and EGFR overexpression has been linked to more advanced disease and poor prognosis. EGFR is often mutated in certain types of cancer and serves as a driver of tumorigenesis. _In vitro_, cetuximab was shown to mediate anti-tumour effects in numerous cancer cell lines and human tumour xenografts. Approved by the FDA in February 2004 under the brand name ERBITUX, cetuximab is used for the treatment of head and neck cancer and metastatic, KRAS wild-type colorectal cancer, and metastatic colorectal cancer with a BRAF V600E mutation. It has also been investigated in advanced colorectal cancer, EGFR-expressing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and unresectable squamous cell skin cancer. Cetuximab is administered via intravenous infusion and is used as monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapies, including platinum agents, radiation therapy, , , and .

## Leuprolide

**Description:**

Leuprolide is a synthetic 9-residue peptide analogue of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Unlike the endogenous decapeptide GnRH, leuprolide contains a single D-amino acid (D-leucyl) residue, which helps to increase its circulating half-life from three to four minutes to approximately three hours. As a GnRH mimic, leuprolide is capable of binding to the GnRH receptor (GnRHR) and inducing downstream modulation of both gonadotropin hormone and sex steroid levels. Prolonged activation of GnRHR results in significant downregulation of sex steroid levels, which is primarily responsible for the clinical efficacy of leuprolide in diverse conditions, including advanced prostate cancer, endometriosis, and central precocious puberty. Leuprolide was first approved in 1985 as a daily subcutaneous injection under the tradename Lupron™ by Abbvie Endocrine Inc. Since this initial approval, various long-acting intramuscular and subcutaneous products have been developed such that patients can be dosed once every six months. Leuprolide remains frontline therapy in all conditions for which it is indicated for use.

## Peginterferon alfa-2b

**Description:**

Peginterferon alfa-2b is a form of recombinant interferon used as part of combination therapy to treat chronic Hepatitis C, an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients . Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) resulting in less use of Peginterferon alfa-2b. Peginterferon alfa-2b is derived from the alfa-2b moeity of recombinant human interferon and acts by binding to human type 1 interferon receptors. Activation and dimerization of this receptor induces the body's innate antiviral response by activating the janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway. Use of Peginterferon alfa-2b is associated with a wide range of severe adverse effects including the aggravation and development of endocrine and autoimmune disorders, retinopathies, cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric complications, and increased risk of hepatic decompensation in patients with cirrhosis. The use of Peginterferon alfa-2b has largely declined since newer interferon-free antiviral therapies have been developed. In a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) no longer recommend Peginterferon alfa-2b for the treatment of Hepatitis C . Peginterferon alfa-2b was used alongside  with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 48 weeks of therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality . Peginterferon alfa-2b is available as a variable dose injectable product (tradename Pegintron) used for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C. Approved in 2001 by the FDA, Pegintron is indicated for the treatment of HCV with  or other antiviral drugs . When combined together, Peginterferon alfa-2b and  have been shown to achieve a SVR between 41% for genotype 1 and 75% for genotypes 2-6 after 48 weeks of treatment.

## Asparaginase Escherichia coli

**Description:**

Asparaginase derived from _Escherichia coli_ (L-asparagine amidohydrolase, EC 3.5.1.1) is an enzyme responsible for the metabolism of L-asparagine, by catalyzing L-asparagine into L-aspartic acid and ammonia. It also facilitates the production of oxaloacetate which is needed for general cellular metabolism. Asparaginase from _E. coli_ has clinically shown to exhibit antitumor actions in models of leukaemias . L-asparaginase of _E. coli_ is marketed under several different trade names, including Elspar, for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) as part of a multi-agent chemotherapeutic regimen. It is available as intramuscular or intravenous injections. Therapeutic L-asparaginase from _E. coli_ works by depleting the levels of non-essential amino acid, asparagine, in lymphoblastic leukemic cells thus promoting apoptotic cell death . For patients who develop hypersensitivity to _E. coli_-derived formulations of L-asparaginase, the use of PEGylated or non-PEGylated  is recommended .

## Aldesleukin

**Description:**

Aldesleukin, a lymphokine, is produced by recombinant DNA technology using a genetically engineered E. coli strain containing an analog of the human interleukin-2 gene. Genetic engineering techniques were used to modify the human IL-2 gene, and the resulting expression clone encodes a modified human interleukin-2. This recombinant form differs from native interleukin-2 in the following ways: a) Aldesleukin is not glycosylated because it is derived from E. coli; b) the molecule has no N-terminal alanine; the codon for this amino acid was deleted during the genetic engineering procedure; c) the molecule has serine substituted for cysteine at amino acid position 125.

**Indications:**

- High Risk Neuroblastoma
- Metastatic Melanoma
- Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma

**Targets:**

## Gemtuzumab ozogamicin

**Description:**

Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is a recombinant humanized IgG4 kappa antibody which is conjugated with calicheamicin derivative, a cytotoxic antitumor antibiotic isolated from fermentation of Micromonospora echinospora ssp. calichensis. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin has approximately 50% of the antibody loaded with 4-6 moles calicheamicin per mole of antibody . The antibody is specifically directed against the CD33 antigen present on leukemic myeloblasts in most patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). By binding to the CD33 antigen on tumors, the cytotoxic agent blocks the growth of cancerous cells and causes cell death.  Marketing approval of gemtuzumab ozogamicin was granted on May 17, 2000 by FDA as a treatment for patients with CD33-positive AML in first relapse who are 60 years of age or older and who are not considered candidates for cytotoxic chemotherapy . However, it was voluntarily withdrawn from the market in 2010 due to safety concerns, increased patient deaths and insufficient evidence of clinical benefit during confirmatory trials . On September 1 2017, gemtuzumab ozogamicin was again approved for the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia but with a lower dosing regimen and a different schedule in combination with chemotherapy or on its own . It is also indicated for the treatment of patients aged 2 years and older with CD33-positive AML who have experienced a relapse or who have not responded to initial treatment (refractory) .

## Pegaspargase

**Description:**

Pegaspargase is a conjugate of monomethoxypolyethylene glycol (mPEG) and L-asparaginase (L-asparagine amidohydrolase), an asparagine-specific enzyme that converts L-asparagine into aspartic acid and ammonia. Asparagine is an amino acid that is vital for cell survival. In humans, most normal tissues can produce asparagine through the action of asparagine synthetase. However, leukemia cells have low levels of this enzyme and depend on exogenous sources. Therefore, the use of pegaspargase results in leukemic cell death.  Pegaspargase has the same mechanism of action as  derived from _Escherichia coli_, a previously developed enzyme used for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, using L-asparaginase derived from _Escherichia coli_ may cause hypersensitivity in some patients and require frequent administration. The pegylation of pegaspargase allows access to the enzyme's active sites while limiting reticuloendothelial system uptake and reducing immune detection, and it also increases the half-life of L-asparaginase. In February 1994, pegaspargase was approved by the FDA for the treatment of ALL in patients with hypersensitivity to native forms of L-asparaginase.

## Trastuzumab

**Description:**

Produced in CHO cell cultures, trastuzumab is a recombinant IgG1 kappa, humanized monoclonal antibody  that selectively binds with high affinity in a cell-based assay (Kd = 5 nM) to the extracellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor protein (HER2). It is used as a treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2+ metastatic breast cancer, where there is a proven amplification of the HER-2 oncogene or over-expression of the HER-2 protein in tumours. It is suggested that the overexpression or gene amplification of HER2 has been found in about 20–30% of breast cancers and elevated activation of HER2 triggers multiple downstream pathways leading to abnormal proliferation of cancer cells . Trastuzumab binds to HER2 and suppresses cancer cell growth, proliferation, and survival directly and indirectly . In December 2017, FDA approved OGIVRI (trastuzumab-dkst) as a biosimilar to Herceptin (trastuzumab) for the treatment of patients with breast or metastatic stomach cancer (gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma) whose tumors overexpress the HER2 gene (HER2+). It displays biosimilar properties as Herceptin according to clinical data. While Ogivri is the first biosimilar approved in the U.S. for the treatment of breast cancer or stomach cancer, it is the second biosimilar approved in the U.S. for the treatment of cancer.

## Trastuzumab

**Description:**

Produced in CHO cell cultures, trastuzumab is a recombinant IgG1 kappa, humanized monoclonal antibody  that selectively binds with high affinity in a cell-based assay (Kd = 5 nM) to the extracellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor protein (HER2). It is used as a treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2+ metastatic breast cancer, where there is a proven amplification of the HER-2 oncogene or over-expression of the HER-2 protein in tumours. It is suggested that the overexpression or gene amplification of HER2 has been found in about 20–30% of breast cancers and elevated activation of HER2 triggers multiple downstream pathways leading to abnormal proliferation of cancer cells . Trastuzumab binds to HER2 and suppresses cancer cell growth, proliferation, and survival directly and indirectly . In December 2017, FDA approved OGIVRI (trastuzumab-dkst) as a biosimilar to Herceptin (trastuzumab) for the treatment of patients with breast or metastatic stomach cancer (gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma) whose tumors overexpress the HER2 gene (HER2+). It displays biosimilar properties as Herceptin according to clinical data. While Ogivri is the first biosimilar approved in the U.S. for the treatment of breast cancer or stomach cancer, it is the second biosimilar approved in the U.S. for the treatment of cancer. Herzuma (trastuzumab-pkrb) is a biosimilar drug approved in December 2018 for the treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. KANJINTI (trastuzumab-anns) is another biosimilar approved by the FDA in June 2019. ONTRUZANT, another biosimilar of Herceptin, was approved by Health Canada in February 2022. In November 2023, trastuzumab was also approved by the EMA under the brand name Herwenda.

## Bevacizumab

**Description:**

There is a great deal of evidence indicating that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is important for the survival and proliferation of cancer cells. VEGF plays an important role in angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, and tumor growth, which are all factors that contribute to its attractiveness as a therapeutic target for anti-cancer therapies.  In 2004, bevacizumab (Avastin) gained FDA approval for specific types of cancer, and became the first antiangiogenic agent introduced to the market. It is a humanized monoclonal IgG antibody, and inhibits angiogenesis by binding and neutralizing VEGF-A. Bevacizumab is generally indicated for use in combination with different chemotherapy regimens which are specific to the type, severity, and stage of cancer. Bevacizumab was approved by Health Canada on March 24, 2010 and by the European Commission on April 21, 2021. There are several biosimilars of bevacizumab, such as bevacizumab-awwb, bevacizumab-maly, bevacizumab-adcd, and bevacizumab-tnjn.  Interestingly, researchers have identified higher VEGF expression in patients with COVID-19, which may contribute to lung pathologies including acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI). As such, bevacizumab is being investigated for the treatment of lung complications associated with severe cases of COVID-19.

## Bortezomib

**Description:**

Bortezomib is a dipeptide boronic acid derivative and proteasome inhibitor used to treat multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. The 26S proteasome is a protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway: reversible inhibition of the 26S proteasome, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of cancer cells, is thought to be the main mechanism of action of bortezomib. However, multiple mechanisms may be involved in the anticancer activity of bortezomib. Bortezomib was first synthesized in 1995. In May 2003, bortezomib became the first anticancer proteasome inhibitor that was approved by the FDA under the trade name VELCADE. Phase I, II, III, and IV clinical trials are undergoing to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of bortezomib in leukemia, myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and solid tumours.

## Mitomycin

**Description:**

Mitomycin is an antineoplastic antibiotic first isolated by Japanese microbiologists in the 1950s from cultures of _Streptomyces caespitosus_. It is an alkylating agent that inhibits DNA synthesis (and, at higher concentrations, RNA and protein synthesis) by cross-linking the complementary strands of the DNA double helix. Few other antibiotics have been discovered that work via this alkylating mechanism, making mitomycin relatively unique in the space of microbiota-derived therapies. Mitomycin's cross-linking activity has resulted in its approval for the treatment of a variety of cancers - the most recent of which is an April 2020 approval for its use in low-grade Upper Tract Urothelial Cancer (LG-UTUC) - as well as adjunctly to _ab externo_ glaucoma surgeries.

## Vinorelbine

**Description:**

Vinorelbine is an anti-mitotic chemotherapy drug that is used in the treatment of several types of malignancies, including breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) .  It was initially approved in the USA in 1990's for the treatment of NSCLC . It is a third-generation vinca alkaloid. The introduction of third-generation drugs (vinorelbine, gemcitabine, taxanes) in platinum combination improved survival of patients with advanced NSCLC, with very similar results from the various drugs. Treatment toxicities are considerable in the combination treatment setting . A study was done on the clearance rate of vinorelbine on individuals with various single polymorphonuclear mutations.  It was found that there was 4.3-fold variation in vinorelbine clearance across the cohort, suggesting a strong influence of genetics on the clearance of this drug .

## Lenalidomide

**Description:**

Lenalidomide (previously referred to as CC-5013) is an immunomodulatory drug with potent antineoplastic, anti-angiogenic, and anti-inflammatory properties. It is a 4-amino-glutamyl analogue of   and like thalidomide, lenalidomide exists as a racemic mixture of the active S(-) and R(+) forms. However, lenalidomide is much safer and potent than thalidomide, with fewer adverse effects and toxicities. Thalidomide and its analogues, including lenalidomide, are referred to as immunomodulatory imide drugs (also known as cereblon modulators), which are a class of immunomodulatory drugs that contain an imide group. Lenalidomide works through various mechanisms of actions that promote malignant cell death and enhance host immunity. Available as oral capsules, lenalidomide is approved by the FDA and EU for the treatment of multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndromes, mantle cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and marginal zone lymphoma in selected patients. Due to severe teratogenicity, pregnancy must be excluded before the start of treatment and patients must enroll in the lenalidomide Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program to ensure contraception adherence.

## Oxaliplatin

**Description:**

Oxaliplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect. However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties. Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics. Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking. However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects. The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin. Although oxaliplatin has been investigated as a monotherapy, it is typically administered in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, known as the FOLFOX regimen, for the treatment of colorectal cancer. This is an effective combination treatment both as a first-line treatment and in patients refractory to an initial fluorouracil and leucovorin combination. Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin’s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer. Oxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.

## Erlotinib

**Description:**

Erlotinib is an inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase that is used in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer and several other types of cancer. It is typically marketed under the trade name Tarceva. Erlotinib binds to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase in a reversible fashion at the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site of the receptor. Recent studies demonstrate that erlotinib is also a potent inhibitor of JAK2V617F, which is a mutant form of tyrosine kinase JAK2 found in most patients with polycythemia vera (PV) and a substantial proportion of patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis or essential thrombocythemia. This finding introduces the potential use of erlotinib in the treatment of JAK2V617F-positive PV and other myeloproliferative disorders.

## Methotrexate

**Description:**

Methotrexate is a folate derivative that inhibits several enzymes responsible for nucleotide synthesis. This inhibition leads to suppression of inflammation as well as prevention of cell division. Because of these effects, methotrexate is often used to treat inflammation caused by arthritis or to control cell division in neoplastic diseases such as breast cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Due to the toxic effects of methotrexate, it is indicated for treatment of some forms of arthritis and severe psoriasis only if first line treatment has failed or patients are intolerant of those treatments. Methotrexate was granted FDA approval on 7 December 1953.

## Imatinib

**Description:**

Imatinib is a small molecule kinase inhibitor that revolutionized the treatment of cancer, particularly chronic myeloid leukemia, in 2001. It was deemed a  miracle drug  due to its clinical success, as oncologist Dr. Brian noted that  complete hematologic responses were observed in 53 of 54 patients with CML treated with a daily dosage of 300 mg or more and typically occurred in the first four weeks of therapy .. The discovery of imatinib also established a new group of therapy called  targeted therapy , since treatment can be tailored specifically to the unique cancer genetics of each patient.  Imatinib was approved on February 1st ,2001 by the FDA and November 7th, 2001 by the EMA; however, its European approval has been withdrawn in October 2023.

## Nilutamide

**Description:**

Nilutamide is an antineoplastic hormonal agent primarily used in the treatment of prostate cancer. Nilutamide is a pure, nonsteroidal anti-androgen with affinity for androgen receptors (but not for progestogen, estrogen, or glucocorticoid receptors). Consequently, Nilutamide blocks the action of androgens of adrenal and testicular origin that stimulate the growth of normal and malignant prostatic tissue. Prostate cancer is mostly androgen-dependent and can be treated with surgical or chemical castration. To date, antiandrogen monotherapy has not consistently been shown to be equivalent to castration.

**Indications:**

- Metastatic Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer

## Imiquimod

**Description:**

Imiquimod is an immune response modifier that acts as a toll-like receptor 7 agonist. Imiquimod is commonly used topically to treat warts on the skin of the genital and anal areas. Imiquimod does not cure warts, and new warts may appear during treatment. Imiquimod does not fight the viruses that cause warts directly, however, it does help to relieve and control wart production. Miquimod is also used to treat a skin condition of the face and scalp called actinic keratoses and certain types of skin cancer called superficial basal cell carcinoma.

**Indications:**

- Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma

**Targets:**

- TLR7
- IFNA1
- SARDH

## Tretinoin

**Description:**

Tretinoin, also known as all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), is a naturally occurring derivative of  (retinol). It is an oxidation product in the physiological pathway of vitamin A metabolism. In human circulation, tretinoin is normally found at very low concentrations, approximately 4 to 14 nmol/L. Tretinoin exhibits anti-inflammatory, antineoplastic, antioxidant, and free radical-scavenging activities. It has been used in dermatology for many years to treat various skin conditions ranging from acne to wrinkles  and activates nuclear receptors to regulate epithelial cell growth and differentiation. Tretinoin is given orally to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia  and topically to treat skin conditions such as acne.

## Etoposide

**Description:**

A semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin that exhibits antitumor activity. Etoposide inhibits DNA synthesis by forming a complex with topoisomerase II and DNA. This complex induces breaks in double stranded DNA and prevents repair by topoisomerase II binding. Accumulated breaks in DNA prevent entry into the mitotic phase of cell division, and lead to cell death. Etoposide acts primarily in the G2 and S phases of the cell cycle.

## Temozolomide

**Description:**

Refractory anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO grade III) and Glioblastoma multiforme (WHO grade IV) are primary malignant brain tumours with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Despite considerable genetic heterogeneity, these tumours often have impaired DNA repair systems, rendering them initially sensitive to alkylating agents, although they invariably develop resistance to these agents over time. Temozolomide is an imidazotetrazine prodrug that is stable at acidic pH but undergoes spontaneous nonenzymatic hydrolysis at neutral or slightly basic pH; these properties allow for both oral and intravenous administration. Following initial hydrolysis, further reactions liberate a highly reactive methyl diazonium cation capable of methylating various residues on adenosine and guanine bases leading to DNA lesions and eventual apoptosis. Temozomolide as an adjunct to radiotherapy followed by maintenance dosing remains the standard of care for both Glioblastoma and refractory anaplastic astrocytoma. Temozolomide was granted FDA approval on August 11, 1999, as an oral capsule and subsequently on February 27, 2009, as an intravenous injection. It is currently marketed under the trademark TEMODAR® by Merck.

## Sirolimus

**Description:**

Sirolimus, also known as rapamycin, is a macrocyclic lactone antibiotic produced by bacteria _Streptomyces hygroscopicus_, which was isolated from the soil of the Vai Atari region of Rapa Nui (Easter Island). It was first isolated and identified as an antifungal agent with potent anticandida activity; however, after its potent antitumor and immunosuppressive activities were later discovered, it was extensively investigated as an immunosuppressive and antitumour agent. Its primary mechanism of action is the inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase that regulates cell growth, proliferation, and survival. mTOR is an important therapeutic target for various diseases, as it was shown to regulate longevity and maintain normal glucose homeostasis. Targeting mTOR received more attention especially in cancer, as mTOR signalling pathways are constitutively activated in many types of human cancer. Sirolimus was first approved by the FDA in 1999 for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients aged 13 years and older receiving renal transplants. In November 2000, the drug was recognized by the European Agency as an alternative to calcineurin antagonists for maintenance therapy with corticosteroids. In May 2015, the FDA approved sirolimus for the treatment of patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis. In November 2021, albumin-bound sirolimus for intravenous injection was approved by the FDA for the treatment of adults with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic malignant perivascular epithelioid cell tumour (PEComa). Sirolimus was also investigated in other cancers such as skin cancer, Kaposi’s Sarcoma, cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, and tuberous sclerosis. The topical formulation of sirolimus, marketed as HYFTOR, was approved by the FDA in April 2022: this marks the first topical treatment approved in the US for facial angiofibroma associated with tuberous sclerosis complex.

## Azacitidine

**Description:**

Azacitidine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analogue with anti-neoplastic activity. It differs from cytosine by the presence of nitrogen in the C5-position, key in its hypomethylating activity. Two main mechanisms of action have been proposed for azacitidine. One of them is the induction of cytotoxicity. As an analogue of cytidine, it is able to incorporate into RNA and DNA, disrupting RNA metabolism and inhibiting protein and DNA synthesis. The other one is through the inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, impairing DNA methylation. Due to its anti-neoplastic activity and its ability to inhibit methylation in replicating DNA, azacytidine has been used mainly used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), two types of cancer characterized by the presence of aberrant DNA methylation. In May 2004, the FDA approved the use of azacitidine administered subcutaneously for the treatment of MDS of all French-American-British (FAB) subtypes. In January 2007, the FDA approved the intravenous administration of azacitidine.

## Doxorubicin

**Description:**

Doxorubicin is a cytotoxic anthracycline antibiotic isolated from cultures of Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius along side with daunorubicin, another cytotoxic agent, in 1970. Although they both have aglyconic and sugar moieties, doxorubicin's side chain terminates with a primary alcohol group compared to the methyl group of daunorubicin. Although its detailed molecular mechanisms have yet to be understood, doxorubicin is generally thought to exert its effect through DNA intercalation, which eventually leads to DNA damage and the generation of reactive oxygen species. Thanks to its efficacy and broad effect, doxorubicin was approved by the FDA in 1974 to treat a variety of cancer, including but not limited to breast, lung, gastric, ovarian, thyroid, non-Hodgkin’s and Hodgkin’s lymphoma, multiple myeloma, sarcoma, and pediatric cancers. However, one of the major side effects of doxorubicin is cardiotoxicity, which excludes patients with poor heart function and requires treatment termination once the maximally tolerated cumulative dose is reached.

## Hydroxyurea

**Description:**

Hydroxyurea is a non-alkylating antineoplastic agent that was first synthesized in 1869 but was not characterized biologically until 1928. It was first approved by the FDA in 1998 for the treatment of sickle cell anemia in adults. Although clinical evidence on the efficacy of hydroxyurea in certain conditions exists, hydroxyurea is used sparingly in clinical settings, largely due to lack of knowledge and adherence, the need for therapeutic monitoring, and serious side effects of secondary cancer and birth defects.

## Docetaxel

**Description:**

Docetaxel is a clinically well established anti-mitotic chemotherapy medication used for the treatment of different types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, and non-small cell lung cancer. Docetaxel is a complex diterpenoid molecule and a semisynthetic analogue of . Docetaxel reversibly binds to microtubulin with high affinity in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio, allowing it to prevent cell division and promote to cell death. Compared to paclitaxel, docetaxel is two times more potent as an inhibitor of microtubule depolymerization. Docetaxel binds to microtubules but does not interact with dimeric tubulin. The use of docetaxel may lead to udesired outcomes such as hepatic impairment, hematologic effects, enterocolitis and neutropenic colitis, hypersensitivity reactions, fluid retention, second primary malignancies, embryo-fetal toxicity, and tumor lysis syndrome. Docetaxel was approved by the FDA in 1996 and is available in solution for injection for intravenous or parenteral administration.

## Dasatinib

**Description:**

Dasatinib is an orally available multikinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive leukemias. Ph is a chromosomal abnormality found in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), where the ABL tyrosine kinase and the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) gene transcribe the chimeric protein BCR-ABL. BCR-ABL is associated with the uncontrolled activity of the ABL tyrosine kinase and is involved in the pathogenesis of CML and 15-30% of ALL cases. Dasatinib also inhibits a spectrum of kinases involved in cancer, including several SRC-family kinases.  Unlike , another tyrosine kinase used for the treatment of CML and Ph-positive ALL, dasatinib inhibits the active and inactive conformations of the ABL kinase domain. Also, mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL may lead to relapse during imatinib treatment. Since dasatinib does not interact with some of the residues involved in those mutations, the use of this drug represents a therapeutic alternative for patients with cancers that have developed imatinib-resistance. The use of dasatinib was first approved by the FDA in 2006.

## Decitabine

**Description:**

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of hematopoietic neoplasms with variable underlying etiology and presentation, including neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Further mutations leading to increased proliferation of cancerous cells can eventually lead to secondary acute myeloid leukemia, which has a poor prognosis. Among treatment options, nucleoside analogues such as decitabine and  integrate into cellular DNA and inhibit the action of DNA methyltransferases, leading to global hypomethylation and related downstream therapeutic benefits. Decitabine was developed by MGI Pharma/SuperGen Inc. and was approved by the FDA for the treatment of MDS on February 5, 2006. It was first marketed under the name Dacogen®. It is also available as an oral combination product together with the cytidine deaminase inhibitor .

## Sunitinib

**Description:**

Sunitinib is a small-molecule multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor. On January 26, 2006, the agent was formally approved by the US FDA for the indications of treating renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). For these purposes, sunitinib is generally available as an orally administered formulation. Sunitinib inhibits cellular signaling by targeting multiple RTKs. These include all platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGF-R) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGF-R). Sunitinib also inhibits KIT (CD117), the RTK that drives the majority of GISTs. In addition, sunitinib inhibits other RTKs including RET, CSF-1R, and flt3.

## Nelarabine

**Description:**

Nelarabine is an antineoplastic agent that is typically used to treat acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia, particularly T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL), in both adult and pediatric patients whose disease has not responded to or has relapsed following at least two chemotherapy regimens. T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoma are relatively rare T-cells malignancy, with only 20 to 25% of patients diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 1.7% of patients diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma having this T-cells variation of the disease. Due to the rarity of these T-cell malignancies, nelarabine was first granted orphan drug status and a fast-track designation by the FDA to address the unmet therapeutic needs of these cancers. Nelarabine is a purine nucleoside analog converted to its corresponding arabinosylguanine nucleotide triphosphate (araGTP), resulting in the inhibition of DNA synthesis and cytotoxicity. Nelarabine preferentially accumulates in T-cells since T-cells have a higher expression of enzymes that convert nelarabine to the active purine analog form, making them effective against T-cells malignancies. Results from 2 phase 2 studies on adult and pediatric T-ALL/T-LBL indicated that nelarabine can yield a 13% complete response (CR) rate in pediatric patients and 18% in adult patients, albeit with serious hematological and neurological adverse events. Nelarabine was first granted accelerated approval by the FDA on October 28, 2005, and was manufactured under the trademark name ARRANON by GlaxoSmithKline. Subsequently, nelarabine was also approved by both Health Canada and European Medicines Agency in 2007 under the trademark name ATRIANCE.

**Indications:**

- Lymphoblastic lymphoma (Precursor T-lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia) refractory
- Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia

## Vorinostat

**Description:**

Vorinostat (rINN) or suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), is a drug currently under investigation for the treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL), a type of skin cancer, to be used when the disease persists, gets worse, or comes back during or after treatment with other medicines. It is the first in a new class of agents known as histone deacetylase inhibitors.  A recent study suggested that vorinostat also possesses some activity against recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, resulting in a median overall survival of 5.7 months (compared to 4 - 4.4 months in earlier studies). Further brain tumor trials are planned using combinations of vorinostat with other drugs.

## Ramucirumab

**Description:**

Ramucirumab is a human monoclonal antibody (IgG1) against vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), a type II trans-membrane tyrosine kinase receptor expressed on endothelial cells. By binding to VEGFR2, ramucirumab prevents binding of its ligands (VEGF-A, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D), thereby preventing VEGF-stimulated receptor phosphorylation and downstream ligand-induced proliferation, permeability, and migration of human endothelial cells. VEGFR stimulation also mediates downstream signalling required for angiogenesis and is postulated to be heavily involved in cancer progression, making it a highly likely drug target. In contrast to other agents directed against VEGFR-2, ramucirumab binds a specific epitope on the extracellular domain of VEGFR-2, thereby blocking all VEGF ligands from binding to it. Ramucirumab is indicated for us in advanced gastric or gastro-esophageal junction adenocarcinoma as a single agent or in combination with paclitaxel after prior fluoropyrimidine- or platinum-containing chemotherapy.

**Indications:**

- Advanced Gastric Cancer
- Advanced gastro-esophageal junction adenocarcinoma
- Refractory, metastatic Colorectal cancer
- Refractory, metastatic Non small cell lung cancer

**Targets:**

- KDR
- PDGFRA
- EGFR

## Trastuzumab emtansine

**Description:**

Trastuzumab emtansine, formerly called Trastuzumab-DM1 (T-DM1) is a first-in-class HER2 antibody drug conjugate (ADC) comprised of Genentech's trastuzumab antibody linked to ImmunoGen's cell-killing agent, DM1. T-DM1 combines two strategies-- anti-HER2 activity and targeted intracellular delivery of the potent anti-microtubule agent, DM1 (a maytansine derivative)--to produce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Trastuzumab emtansine is marketed under the brand name Kadcyla and is indicated for use in HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer patients who have already used taxane and/or trastuzumab for metastatic disease or had their cancer recur within 6 months of adjuvant treatment. The FDA label has two precautions. First that trastuzumab emtansine and trastuzumab cannot be interchanged. Second that there is a black box warning of serious side effects such as hepatotoxicity, embryo-fetal toxicity, and cardiac toxicity.

**Indications:**

- Refractory, metastatic Non small cell lung cancer

## Pixantrone

**Description:**

Pixantrone is an aza-anthracenedione and DNA intercalator which inhibits topoisomerase II. It is similar in structure to anthracyclines such as mitoxantrone, but exerts fewer toxic effects on cardiac tissue.  The lower cardio-toxic effects of pixantrone may be explained, in part, by its redox inactivity . Pixantrone does not bind iron and promotes the formation of reactive oxygen species to a lesser degree than other anthracyclines. It also inhibits doxorubicinol formation in human myocardium.  As a result, it is believed to be less cardiotoxic while still exerting efficacy.   Pixantrone was designed to treat relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma(NHL) in patients who have failed two prior lines of therapy.  For patients suffering from NHL, first line therapies consist of anthracycline containing multi-drug treatments which unfortunately are known to cause irreversible myocardial tissue damage. Patients refractory to treatment, or those who relapse, are discouraged from further anthracycline use due to cumulative cardiotoxicity. Pixantrone dimaleate, administered intravenously, was designed by Cell Therapeutics Incorporated as an alternative second line therapy in refractory or relapsed NHL. It is currently being tested in Phase III trials.  Although pixantrone has not yet received FDA approval in the United States, it has been granted conditional marketing approval by the European Union. Conditional approval was granted by the European Medicines Agency after a phase III EXTEND trial of patients with NHL showed that pixantrone was tolerable and that it resulted in significantly higher complete response rate and progression free survival in comparison to other single chemotherapy agents. However, it is notable that the EXTEND trial was stopped early, leaving the statistical significance of the results in question. Based on this uncertainty, in 2009, the FDA ultimately rejected Cell Therapeutic's initial application for accelerated approval for pixantrone use in relapsed or refractory NHL. Another phase III trial, PIX-R, is now ongoing to clarify pixantrones place in therapy. It will compare pixantrone efficacy to that of gemcitabine.

## Eflornithine

**Description:**

Eflornithine is an irreversible ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor originally developed as a treatment for human African trypanosomiasis. Further research has also implicated ornithine decarboxylase in other conditions like facial hirsutism and cancer, especially when ornithine decarboxylase is highly upregulated in tumor cells. Additionally, ornithine decarboxylase is activated by c-myc or interacts with ras, both very well-known oncogenes, thus increasing the interest in targeting ornithine carboxylase as a potential cancer treatment. In 1960 and 2000, the FDA approved eflornithine under the brand names ORNIDYL and VANIQUA for the treatment of African trypanosomiasis and hirsutism, respectively, but has since been discontinued. Subsequently, on December 14, 2023, the FDA approved eflornithine again but under the brand name IWILFIN as an oral maintenance therapy to reduce the risk of relapse in adult and pediatric patients with high-risk neuroblastoma who have demonstrated at least a partial response to prior multiagent, multimodality therapy, including anti-GD2 immunotherapy. This approval is based on positive results obtained from a multi-site, single-arm, externally controlled study of children with high-risk neuroblastoma, where a 52% reduction in the risk of relapse and a 68% reduction in the risk of death were observed.

## Elacestrant

**Description:**

Elacestrant is a non-steroidal small molecule and an estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist. In January 2023, it was approved by the FDA for the treatment of ER-positive, HER2-negative, ESR1-mutated advanced or metastatic breast cancer. It received a similar approval in the EU in September 2023.  Elacestrant binds to estrogen receptor-alpha (ERα) and acts as a selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) thanks to its ability to block the transcriptional activity of the ER and promote its degradation. Other types of endocrine therapy, such as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and aromatase inhibitors (AIs), may lead to drug resistance over time; therefore, the use of a SERD represents a therapeutic approach for the treatment of endocrine-resistant breast cancers. Unlike , another FDA-approved SERD, elacestrant is orally bioavailable.

**Indications:**

- Advanced Breast Cancer, Metastatic Breast Cancer

**Targets:**

- ESR1
- ERBB2

## Bosutinib

**Description:**

Bosutinib is a 7-alkoxy-3-quinolinecarbonitrile that functions as a potent, dual SRC and ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor indicated for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), specifically Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) CML. Philadelphia chromosome is a hallmark of CML due to the reciprocal translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11), resulting in a BCR-ABL fusion protein. The first BCR-ABL inhibitor, , was introduced over a decade ago as a breakthrough in CML management; however, emerging resistance to  poses challenges in achieving remission. Second-generation BCR-ABL inhibitors like bosutinib inhibit most resistance-conferring BCR-ABL mutations except V299L and T315, thus providing more therapeutic options for patients. Bosutinib was first approved by the FDA in 2012 for the treatment of adult chronic, accelerated, or blast-phase Ph+ CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy. On September 26, 2023, bosutinib was also approved by the FDA for the treatment of pediatric CML that is newly diagnosed or resistant/intolerant to prior therapy. This approval was based on favorable results obtained from the open-label, randomized, multicenter trial BFORE that showed a significant improvement in major molecular response, defined as a ≤0.1% BCR ABL ratio on an international scale, with bosutinib treatment.

## Ofatumumab

**Description:**

Ofatumumab is a novel anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that targets B-cells. It is an IgG1κ human monoclonal antibody produced from a recombinant murine cell line (NS0) via transgenic mouse and hybridoma technology. Ofatumumab works by recognizing antigens that are expressed on the tumour cells in certain cancers; however, the antigen is not tumour-specific and can also be found in normal B-cells. Ofatumumab was first approved by the FDA in 2009. It is used in the treatment of recurrent, progressive, or recurrent chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or CLL in treatment-naive patients in whom fludarabine-based therapy is considered inappropriate. Ofatumumab is used as monotherapy or in combination with other medications, depending on the patient profile and previous treatment history. Although it has a similar molecular mechanism of action as , another CD-20 monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, ofatumumab has a higher affinity towards CD20. Ofatumumab is available for intravenous administration and is marketed as Arzerra. In Phase III clinical trials consisting of subjects with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS), subcutaneous administration of ofatumumab reduced the number of relapses and delayed disease progression. In February 2020, FDA and EMA approved Supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) and Marketing Authorization Application (MAA), respectively, for ofatumumab for the treatment of RMS in adults. The FDA subsequently approved ofatumumab for the treatment of RMS on August 20, 2020. The potential therapeutic use of ofatumumab in various lymphomas and rheumatoid arthritis has also been investigated.

**Indications:**

- Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL)
- Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) - Refractory

## Histrelin

**Description:**

Histrelin is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist that acts as a potent inhibitor of gonadotropin when administered as an implant delivering continuous therapeutic doses. This drug is a synthetic analog of naturally occurring GnRH with a higher potency. Histrelin implants are non-biodegradable, diffusion-controlled, hydrogel polymer reservoirs containing histrelin acetate that need to be replaced every 52 weeks. Initially, histrelin implants were developed to reduce testosterone to castration levels in patients with advanced prostate cancer. The Vantas product was approved by the FDA in October 2004 for the palliative treatment of this condition. Vantas was later discontinued by Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. on September 21, 2021. GnRH agonists are the first line of treatment for children with central precocious puberty (CPP) due to their capacity to reduce LH levels and the concentration of sex steroids. As the product Supprelin LA, histrelin is indicated for the treatment of CPP in children (approved by the FDA in May 2007).

## Pralatrexate

**Description:**

Pralatrexate is an antifolate for the treatment of relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma . Pralatrexate was developed in response due to the inferior responses of patients using the standard therapy for their B-cells counterparts. Compared to methotrexate, pralatrexate has better accumulation in cancer cells. Pralatrexate is designed to have a higher affinity for the reduced folate carrier, a protein that is overexpressed in malignant cells and is upregulated by oncogenes. As such, pralatrexate is thought to have a better therapeutic window compared to other antifolate analogs due to the novel target of RFC. Pralatrexate was approved by the FDA on September 24, 2009. It is also being studied for other types of lymphoma and solid malignancy such as non-small-cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and bladder cancer.

**Indications:**

- Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL)
- Relapsed Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma
- Refractory Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma Unspecified

## Vismodegib

**Description:**

Vismodegib is an orally active small molecule that inhibits the hedgehog signaling pathway by binding to and inhibiting the transmembrane protein smoothened homologue (SMO). It was discovered by high-throughput screening of a library of small-molecule compounds and subsequent optimization through medicinal chemistry. Since it targets the hedgehog signaling pathway, vismodegib has anti-tumor activity in basal-cell carcinoma. The Hedgehog signaling pathway plays an important role in the development of organs and tissues during embryogenesis. Afterwards, it is silenced in all cells and tissues, except for hair, skin and stem cells. However, dysregulated or aberrant Hedgehog signaling has been associated with basal cell carcinoma pathogenesis. In January 2012, vismodegib was approved by the FDA for the treatment of adult basal cell carcinoma. In July 2013, it was approved by the EMA, and since then, it has been approved by several other countries.

**Indications:**

- Locally Advanced Basal Cell Carcinoma
- Metastatic Basal cell carcinoma

**Targets:**

- SMO
- PTCH1
- SHH

## Crizotinib

**Description:**

Crizotinib is a tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor used for the treatment of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) or ROS1-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors, as well as ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT). By targeting the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK fusion protein, crizotinib offers robust effectiveness in treating NSCLC in patients with this type of rearrangement. Crizotinib was the first-in-class drug used to treat ALK-positive tumors. Second- and third-generation ALK-tyrosine kinase-inhibitors have overcome many of the pharmacodynamic and genetic resistance mechanisms crizotinib is prone to. Crizotinib was approved by the FDA in 2011, and its use is accompanied by FDA-approved tests used to detect ALK and ROS1 rearrangements.

## Brentuximab vedotin

**Description:**

Brentuximab vedotin, also known as Adcetris®, is an antibody-drug conjugate that combines an anti-CD30 antibody with the drug monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). It is an anti-neoplastic agent used in the treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma and systemic anaplastic large-cell lymphoma. Brentuximab vedotin was initially approved in 2011. In January 2012, the drug label was revised with a boxed warning of a condition known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and death due to opportunistic JC virus infection post-treatment. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Adcetris in March 2018 to treat adult patients with previously untreated stage III or IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) in combination with chemotherapy. Adcetris has also been previously approved by the FDA to treat Hodgkin's lymphoma after relapse, Hodgkin's lymphoma after stem cell transplantation when a patient has a high risk of relapse or progression, systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) after the failure of other treatment regimens, and primary cutaneous ALCL after failure of other treatment regimens. Lymphoma is a malignancy that begins in the lymphatic system, which helps to combat infection and disease. Lymphoma may begin anywhere in the body and can spread to nearby lymph nodes. The two main types of lymphoma are Hodgkin lymphoma (also called Hodgkin disease) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Most individuals with Hodgkin's lymphoma have the classical type. In this type of lymphoma, large, abnormal lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) are found in the lymph nodes called Reed-Sternberg cells. With early diagnosis and intervention, patients with Hodgkin lymphoma normally experience long-term remission. The ECHELON-1 study results demonstrated superior efficacy of the drug combined with a chemotherapy regimen compared to the previous standard of care. Importantly,  bleomycin - a highly toxic agent - was completely removed from the regimen. This demonstrates meaningful progress in treatment for patients affected by this disease.

## Ruxolitinib

**Description:**

Ruxolitinib, formerly known as INCB018424 or INC424, is an anticancer drug and a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. It is a potent and selective inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2, which are tyrosine kinases involved in cytokine signalling and hematopoiesis. Myeloproliferative neoplasms, such as myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera, are often characterized by aberrant activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, leading to abnormal blood cell counts and thrombotic complications. By inhibiting JAK1 and JAK2, ruxolitinib works to block the dysregulated cell signalling pathways and prevents abnormal blood cell proliferation. Due to a large number of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms who have JAK2 mutations, ruxolitinib was the first ATP-competitive inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2 ever developed. Ruxolitinib was first approved for the treatment of adult patients with myelofibrosis by the FDA in 2011, followed by EMA's approval in 2012. In 2014, it was approved for the treatment of polycythemia vera in adults who have an inadequate response to or are intolerant of  and in 2019, ruxolitinib was approved for use in steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease in adults and children. The topical formulation of ruxolitinib is used to treat atopic dermatitis and vitiligo. It is being investigated for other inflammatory skin conditions. Ruxolitinib has been investigated to treat patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) accompanied by severe systemic hyperinflammation. In phase II clinical trials, ruxolitinib improved chest computed tomography and improved recovery in patients with lymphopenia. However, phase III clinical trials later determined that ruxolitinib was inadequate in meeting its primary endpoint of reducing the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients who experienced severe complications  thus the drug was not approved as a treatment for COVID-19.

## Aflibercept

**Description:**

Aflibercept is a recombinant protein composed of the binding domains of two human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, fused with the Fc region of human immunoglobulin gamma 1 (IgG1). Structurally, Aflibercept is a dimeric glycoprotein with a protein molecular weight of 96.9 kilo Daltons (kDa). It contains approximately 15% glycosylation to give a total molecular weight of 115 kDa. All five putative N-glycosylation sites on each polypeptide chain predicted by the primary sequence can be occupied with carbohydrates and exhibit some degree of chain heterogeneity, including heterogeneity in terminal sialic acid residues, except at the single unsialylated site associated with the Fc domain. Due to the 2 fused VEGFR, aflibercept has a higher affinity to the cognate ligands than the endogenous individual receptor. However, it lacks the intracellular structure to propagate subsequent signal transduction, thus essentially sequestering the ligands to prevent activation of VEGFR. Ziv-aflibercept, under the brand name Zaltrap, was developed as an intravenous injection for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, and it was approved by the FDA and EMA in August 2012 and February 2013, respectively. The intravitreal formulation, under the brand name EYELEA, was approved by the FDA for the treatment of retinopathy of prematurity in preterm infants in February 2023 and for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema, and diabetic retinopathy in August 2023. An aflibercept biosimilar, Yesafili, was approved for use in the EU in September 2023.

**Indications:**

- Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (MCRC)

## Enzalutamide

**Description:**

Enzalutamide is an androgen receptor (AR) inhibitor for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), both metastatic and non-metastatic. It is a second-generation antiandrogen agent that the FDA approved on August 31, 2012. Although androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the first-line treatment of prostate cancer and remission can be achieved, arising resistance is inevitable, becoming castration-resistant prostate cancer. Until recently, docetaxel is the only treatment available for metastatic CRPC; however, AR inhibitors have been developed for more targeted therapy, although first-generation AR inhibitors like bicalutamide did not substantially increase the survival rate. Second-generation such as enzalutamide is more efficacious due to a higher affinity to AR and no partial agonist activity compared to bicalutamide. Due to a favorable pharmacological profile, a phase 1 study of enzalutamide was initiated in July 2007. Compared to the average time of 10 to 15 years for a drug to go from pre-clinical to clinical studies, enzalutamide was developed relatively rapidly.

**Indications:**

- Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer

**Targets:**

- BRAF
- ATR

## Blinatumomab

**Description:**

Blinatumomab is a BiTE-class (bi-specific T-cell engager) constructed monoclonal antibody formed by the recombinant fusion of an anti-CD3 single-chain variable fragment (scFV) and an anti-CD19 scFV through a short peptide linker. CD3 is an antigen expressed on the surface of T-cells, while CD19 is mostly expressed on the surface of malignant B-cells. Since blinatumomab has an affinity to both antigens, it redirects T-cells to tumor cells expressing CD19 and promotes tumor cell lysis and apoptosis. Blinatumomab is manufactured by Amgen Inc. and marketed under the brand Blincyto. It was first approved by the FDA in December 2014 for the treatment of CD19-positive B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in relapsed and refractory patients. In March 2018, it was approved under the FDA’s accelerated approval program for the treatment of CD19-positive B-cell precursor ALL in first or second complete remission with minimal residual disease (MRD) greater than or equal to 0.1% in adults and children. Full approval for this indication was granted in June 2023. Blinatumomab has a short half-life, requiring patients to receive a continuous infusion over 4-week cycles using a portable mini-pump for optimum delivery.

**Indications:**

- Precursor B-Lymphoblastic Lymphoma/Leukaemia Refractory
- Relapsed B cell precursor Acute lymphoblastic leukemia

## Idelalisib

**Description:**

Idelalisib is a phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor indicated in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), relapsed follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (FL), and relapsed small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). For the treatment of relapsed CLL, it is currently indicated as a second-line agent in combination with rituximab in patients for whom rituximab alone would be considered appropriate therapy due to other co-morbidities, while in the treatment of FL and SLL it is intended to be used in patients who have received at least two prior systemic therapies. More specifically, idelalisib targets P110δ, the delta isoform of the enzyme phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, also known as PI-3K. The PI-3Ks are a family of enzymes involved in cellular functions such as cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility, survival and intracellular trafficking, which in turn are involved in cancer. In contrast to the other class IA PI3Ks p110α and p110β, p110δ is principally expressed in leukocytes (white blood cells) and is important for the function of T cells, B cell, mast cells and neutrophils. By inhibiting this enzyme, idelalisib induces apoptosis of malignant cells and inhibits several cell signaling pathways, including B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and C-X-C chemokine receptors type 5 and type 4 signalling, which are involved in trafficking and homing of B-cells to the lymph nodes and bone marrow. Treatment of lymphoma cells with idelalisib has been shown to result in inhibition of chemotaxis and adhesion, and reduced cell viability.

## Ceritinib

**Description:**

Ceritinib is used for the treatment of adults with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) following failure (secondary to resistance or intolerance) of prior crizotinib therapy. About 4% of patients with NSCLC have a chromosomal rearrangement that generates a fusion gene between EML4 (echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4) and ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase), which results in constitutive kinase activity that contributes to carcinogenesis and seems to drive the malignant phenotype. Ceritinib exerts its therapeutic effect by inhibiting autophosphorylation of ALK, ALK-mediated phosphorylation of the downstream signaling protein STAT3, and proliferation of ALK-dependent cancer cells. Following treatment with crizotinib (a first-generation ALK inhibitor), most tumours develop drug resistance due to mutations in key  gatekeeper  residues of the enzyme. This occurrence led to development of novel second-generation ALK inhibitors such as ceritinib to overcome crizotinib resistance. The FDA approved ceritinib in April 2014 due to a surprisingly high response rate (56%) towards crizotinib-resistant tumours and has designated it with orphan drug status.

## Dinutuximab

**Description:**

Dinutuximab is an IgG1 monoclonal human/mouse chimeric antibody against GD2, a disialoganglioside expressed on tumors of neuroectodermal origin, including human neuroblastoma and melanoma, with highly restricted expression on normal tissues. It is composed of the variable heavy- and light-chain regions of the murine anti-GD2 mAb 14.18 and the constant regions of human IgG1 heavy-chain and kappa light-chain. By binding to GD2, dinutiximab induces antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity of tumor cells thereby leading to apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation of the tumour. It is indicated, in combination with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and 13-cis-retinoic acid (RA), for the treatment of pediatric patients with high-risk neuroblastoma who achieve at least a partial response to prior first-line multiagent, multimodality therapy. Despite a high clinical response seen after first-line treatment, the complete eradication of neuroblastoma is rarely achieved and the majority of patients with advanced disease suffer a relapse. Current strategies for treatment include immunotherapy with drugs such as dinutuximab to target surviving neuroblastoma cells and to prevent relapse.

**Indications:**

- High Risk Neuroblastoma

**Targets:**

- MYCN

## Lenvatinib

**Description:**

Lenvatinib is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor that inhibits the kinase activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4). Lenvatinib also inhibits other RTKs that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4; the platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), KIT, and RET. These receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) located in the cell membrane play a central role in the activation of signal transduction pathways involved in the normal regulation of cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis and differentiation, and in pathogenic angiogenesis, lymphogenesis, tumour growth and cancer progression. In particular, VEGF has been identified as a crucial regulator of both physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis and increased expression of VEGF is associated with a poor prognosis in many types of cancers. Lenvatinib is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine (RAI)-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. Most patients with thyroid cancer have a very good prognosis with treatment (98% 5 year survival rate) involving surgery and hormone therapy. However, for patients with RAI-refractory thyroid cancer, treatment options are limited and the prognosis is poor, leading to a push for the development of more targeted therapies such as lenvatinib.

**Indications:**

- Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma
- Locally recurrent radioactive iodine-refractory Thyroid cancer
- Metastatic radioactive iodine-refractory Thyroid cancer
- Progressive radioactive iodine-refractory Thyroid cancer

## Osimertinib

**Description:**

Osimertinib is an oral, third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) drug developed by AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals. Its use is indicated for the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in cases where tumour EGFR expression is positive for the T790M mutation as detected by FDA-approved testing and which has progressed following therapy with a first-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Approximately 10% of patients with NSCLC have a rapid and clinically effective response to EGFR-TKIs due to the presence of specific activating EGFR mutations within the tumour cells. More specifically, deletions around the LREA motif in exon 19 and exon 21 L858R point mutations are correlated with response to therapy. Development of third-generation EGFR-TKIs, such as osimertinib, has been in response to altered tumour resistance patterns following treatment and toxic side effects that impact patient quality of life. Treatment with first-generation EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib and erlotinib) has been associated with the development of resistance through activating mutations in the EGFR gene. Second-generation EGFR-TKIs (afatinib and dacomitinib) were then developed to be more potent inhibitors, although their use is associated with increased toxicity through nonspecific targeting of wild-type EGFR. In contrast, third-generation inhibitors are specific for the gate-keeper T790M mutations which increases ATP binding activity to EGFR and result in poor prognosis for late-stage disease. Furthermore, osimertinib has been shown to spare wild-type EGFR during therapy, thereby reducing non-specific binding and limiting toxicity.

## Necitumumab

**Description:**

Necitumumab is an intravenously administered recombinant monoclonal IgG1 antibody used in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as an EGFR antagonist. It functions by binding to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and prevents binding of its ligands, a process that is involved in cell proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, and malignant progression. Binding of necitumumab to EGFR induces receptor internalization and degradation, thereby preventing further activation of EGFR which is beneficial in NSCLC as many patients have increased protein expression of EGFR. Necitumumab is approved for use in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine as a first-line treatment for metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

**Indications:**

- Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer

## Vinflunine

**Description:**

Vinflunine is a third-generation member of the vinca alkaloid family with anti-tumour actions. It was first described in 1998 at the Pierre Fabre research center in France. Like other vinca agents, vinflunine is an anti-mitotic agent that induces a cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and promotes cell death via apoptosis . Vinflunine is a microtubule inhibitor that binds to tubulin at or near to the vinca binding sites to inhibits its polymerization into microtubules during cell proliferation . In murine tumors and human tumor xenografts, vinflunine exhibits an antitumor efficacy than , , and  .  Having an incidence of 429,700 new cases per year worldwide, urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is one of the most common malignancies that mostly affects individuals aged 50–79 years . Some patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma experience inadequate therapeutic response from a prior platinum-containing regimen. While these patients have a median survival of approximately 4 months and a poor prognosis , there is currently no standard therapy in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma . In 2009, vinflunine was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as a second-line therapy of metastatic and advanced urothelial cancer after failure of platinum-based treatment . Vinflunine ditartrate is an active ingredient in the EMA-authorised product Javlor for intravenous infusion. Efficacy and safety of vinflunine has not been studied in patients with performance status of 2 or less. The clinical use of vinflunine in other urologic malignancies, such as inoperable cancer of the penis, are currently have been investigated .

## Fruquintinib

**Description:**

Fruquintinib is a novel small-molecule anti-VEGFR that targets VEGFR-1,-2, and -3 to inhibit angiogenesis. Tumor angiogenesis is one of the most critical biological processes for increasing oxygen and nutrient supply to cancer cells, and the VEGF/VEGFR pathway is one of the most critical pathways for this phenomenon. Indeed, oncogenic activation, loss of tumor suppressor function, and hypoxia, usually facilitated by cancer cells, are known to upregulate VEGF. There are 2 major approaches to combatting tumor angiogenesis: neutralization of VEGF/VEGFR activity through monoclonal antibodies or blockage of VEGFR kinase activity through small-molecule inhibitors. The first approach can be exemplified by , a VEGF-A trap antibody. Although  is successful in sustaining target inhibition, mandatory intravenous dosing, immunogenicity, and the potential to induce autoimmune diseases hinder its clinical application. For the small-molecule approach, most earlier generations of VEGFR inhibitors such as , , , and  have poor selectivity, thus increasing the risk of off-target toxicity. Therefore, the advent of fruquintinib, a new generation of VEGFR inhibitors with a high kinome selectivity, demonstrated the feasibility of the small-molecule inhibitor approach. On November 8th, 2023, fruquintinib was approved by the FDA under the brand name Fruzaqla for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) who received prior fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, an anti-VEGF therapy, and, if RAS wild-type and medically appropriate, an anti-EGFR therapy. This approval is based on favorable results obtained from the FRESCO and FRESCO-2 trials, where an increase in overall survival rate was observed in both trials.

## Acalabrutinib

**Description:**

To date, acalabrutinib has been used in trials studying the treatment of B-All, myelofibrosis, ovarian cancer, multiple myeloma, and Hodgkin lymphoma, among others. As of October 31, 2017 the FDA approved Astra Zeneca's orally administered Calquence (acalabrutinib, capsules). This Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor indicated for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, small lymphocytic lymphoma, and in adult patients with Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have already received at least one prior therapy. In August 2022, the FDA approved a new tablet formulation of Calquence, enabling the co-administration of this drug with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Unlike Calquence capsules, the co-administration of Calquence tablets and PPIs does not have an effect in the pharmacokinetics of acalabrutinib. Also known as ACP-196, acalabrutinib is also considered a second generation BTK inhibitor because it was rationally designed to be more potent and selective than ibrutinib, theoretically expected to demonstrate fewer adverse effects owing to minimized bystander effects on targets other than BTK. Nevertheless, acalabrutinib was approved under the FDA's accelerated approval pathway, which is based upon overall response rate and faciliates earlier approval of medicines that treat serious conditions or/and that fill an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint. Continued approval for acalabrutinib's currently accepted indication may subsequently be contingent upon ongoing verification and description of clinical benefit in confimatory trials. Furthermore, the FDA granted this medication Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy designations. It also received Orphan Drug designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases. At this time, more than 35 clinical trials across 40 countries with more than 2500 patients are underway or have been completed with regards to further research into better understanding and expanding the therapeutic uses of acalabrutinib .

## Tremelimumab

**Description:**

Tremelimumab, formerly known as ticilimumab, is a fully human IgG2 monoclonal antibody directed against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4). CTLA-4 is a cell surface receptor expressed on activated T cells to act as a negative regulator for T cells. By binding to CTLA-4, tremelimumab enhances T cell-mediated killing of tumours and reduces tumour growth. Because CTLA-4 is an immune checkpoint that plays a vital role in regulating T cell-mediated immune response, tremelimumab is considered an immune checkpoint inhibitor, which is an emerging cancer immunotherapy drug class. Tremelimumab was first approved by the FDA in October 2022 to be used in combination with  to treat hepatocellular carcinoma. It is also being investigated in other cancers, such as colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and malignant melanoma. After receiving an EMA Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommendation in December 2022, tremelimumab was approved for combined use with .

## Capmatinib

**Description:**

Capmatinib is a small molecule kinase inhibitor targeted against c-Met (a.k.a. hepatocyte growth factor receptor ), a receptor tyrosine kinase that, in healthy humans, activates signaling cascades involved in organ regeneration and tissue repair. Aberrant c-Met activation - via mutations, amplification, and/or overexpression - is known to occur in many types of cancer, and leads to overactivation of multiple downstream signaling pathways such as STAT3, PI3K/ATK, and RAS/MAPK. Mutations in _MET_ have been detected in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and the prevalence of _MET_ amplification in epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI)-naive patients with NSCLC has been reported to be 1.4% - 21%. This co-occurrence has made c-Met a desirable target in the treatment of NSCLC. Manufactured by Novartis and marketed under the brand name Tabrecta, capmatinib was granted accelerated approval by the FDA on May 6, 2020, for the treatment of NSCLC in patients whose tumors have a mutation that leads to mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) exon 14 skipping. The presence of the mutation must be confirmed by an FDA-approved test, such as the FoundationOne CDx assay (manufactured by Foundation Medicine, Inc.), which was approved by the FDA on the same day. As this indication was granted under an accelerated approval, its continued approval is contingent upon verification of capmatinib's benefit in confirmatory trials. Capmatinib was approved by Health Canada on June 8, 2022.

**Indications:**

- Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer

**Targets:**

- DRD4
- MET
- PTEN

## Apalutamide

**Description:**

Apalutamide is a potent androgen receptor (AR) antagonist that selectively binds to the ligand-binding domain of AR and blocks AR nuclear translocation or binding to androgen response elements . It has been used in trials studying the treatment of Prostate Cancer, Hepatic Impairment, Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer, and Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant, among others. Exerting an antitumor action, apalutamide blocking the effect of androgens that promote tumor growth. It targets the AR ligand-binding domain and prevents AR nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and transcription of AR gene targets in prostate tumors . In mice bearing human CRPC xenograft models, apalutamide treatment produced tumor regressions in a dose-dependent manner that was more effective than that of  or . Unlike bicalutamide, apalutamide antagonized AR-mediated signaling in AR overexpressing human CRPC cell lines . Androgen-deprivation therapy, or hormone therapy, can be used as part of maintenance therapy for patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer. Although most patients achieve therapeutic responses at the initial hormone therapy, many patients progress to non-metastatic castration-resistant (resistance to hormone therapy) prostate cancer which is the second-most common cause of cancer-related deaths in American males . Castration-resistant prostate cancer is often incurable, which poses significant clinical challenges for patients. Approximately 10 to 20 % of prostate cancer cases are castration-resistant, and up to 16% of these patients show no evidence of cancer metastasis at the time of castration-resistant diagnosis . Higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and shorter PSA doubling time (PSA DT) are associated with a higher risk for metastases and death . In a phase-2 multicenter open-label study, 89% of patients with non-metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer had ≥50% PSA decline at week 12 of apalutamide treatment . In a randomized trial, the median metastasis-free survival for patients taking apalutamide was 40.5 months compared to 16.2 months for patients taking a placebo . Apalutamide displayed good tolerability and safety profile in clinical studies.  Apalutamide was approved in February 2018 by the FDA as Erleada for the treatment of patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer that is resistant to treatment with hormone therapy (castration-resistant). It is available as oral tablets. Apalutamide is the first FDA-approved treatment for non-metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer .

**Indications:**

- Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer

**Targets:**

- AR

Glasdegib, also known as PF-04449913, is a small-molecule hedgehog signaling inhibitor selected under the group of benzimidazoles. In early research, benzimidazoles attracted large interest as they represented a class of inhibitors with low molecular weight, potent inhibitory activity, and lacking unstable functionality. The great lipophilicity of this group of compounds brought interest to further modification. This analysis concluded that the presence of p-cyano ureas presented good physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties from which glasdegib was developed.  Glasdegib was developed by Pfizer Inc and approved on November 21, 2018 by the FDA for the treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Glasdegib targets cancerous cells by inhibiting the sonic hedgehog receptor smoothened (SMO), a transmembrane protein involved in the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling cascade. Aberrant of Hh signaling is one of the main pathophysiologies of AML, with observed overexpression or constitutive activation of SMO. Although the efficacy of glasdegib monotherapy is limited, the landmark Phase 2 Bright AML 1003 trial showed a superior overall survival and complete response when glasdegib is combined with low dose cytarabine. Currently, the current gold standard of AML in older patients is still venetoclax with hypomethylation agents, new clinical combinations of glasdegib are being tested in hope of replacing venetoclax due to glasdegib's more favorable side effects profile.

**Indications:**

- Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)

**Targets:**

- SMO
- ALOX12
- MTOR
- FLT3

## Nirogacestat

**Description:**

Nirogacestat is a small-molecule gamma-secretase inhibitor that was investigated as a potential treatment for desmoid tumors. Desmoid tumors are typically characterized by aberrant activation in Notch signaling. Interaction between the notch receptors and their ligands activates proteolytic cleavage by gamma-secretase; therefore, the inhibition of gamma-secretase can potentially inhibit Notch signaling and thus impede the growth of desmoid tumors. Nirogacestat was approved under the brand name OGSIVEO on November 27, 2023, by the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with progressing desmoid tumors who require systemic treatment. It was previously granted breakthrough therapy, fast track, and orphan drug designations for the treatment of desmoid tumors, and the final approval was based on positive results obtained in the Phase 3 DeFi trial, where a confirmed objective response rate was observed to be 41% compared to 8% with the placebo.

**Indications:**

- Progressive Desmoid Tumors

## Alpelisib

**Description:**

Alpelisib is a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor with potent antitumor activity. It works by selectively inhibiting class I PI3K p110α , which is the catalytic subunit of PI3K, a lipid kinase that plays a role in various biological processes, including proliferation, survival, differentiation, and metabolism. Alpelisib was designed to target this enzyme that appears to be mutated at a rate of nearly 30% in human cancers, leading to hyperactivation.  There are several isoform-specific PI3K inhibitors that are under clinical development or currently approved, such as  used for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Approved by the FDA in May 2019, alpelisib is the first approved PI3K inhibitor indicated for the treatment of hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, PIK3CA-mutated, advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with  for postmenopausal women and male patients. To initiate alpelisib therapy, it is required that the presence of a PIK3CA mutation in the tissue and/or liquid biopsy sample collection should be confirmed via FDA-approved diagnostic tests. Alpelisib is marketed under the trade name Piqray and is available as oral tablets. Studies evaluating the therapeutic effectiveness of alpelisib in other cancers, such as ovarian cancer  and colorectal cancer , are under ongoing investigations. Alpelisib was granted FDA approval on 24 May 2019. In April 2022, the FDA granted the use of alpelisib in the treatment of PIK3CA-Related Overgrowth Spectrum (PROS) in adults and children who require systemic therapy.

## Capivasertib

**Description:**

Hormone receptor (HR) positive, especially estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer is the most common subtype of metastatic breast cancer, resulting in more than 400,000 deaths annually. Although endocrine-based therapy is the first line of treatment, resistance eventually emerges, leaving chemotherapy the only but often ineffective treatment left. Therefore, significant research has been put into developing genetically targeted treatments. The PIK3/AKT pathway is one of the most commonly activated pathways in breast cancer, mainly through the constitutively active mutation in AKT1, loss of function mutation in PTEN, a negative regulator of the PIK3/AKT pathway, or PIK3CA mutations. Therefore, targeting the PIK3/AKT pathway presents a promising approach for the treatment of breast cancer, leading to the development of capivasertib, a pan-AKT kinase inhibitor. On November 17th, 2023, capivasertib, under the brand name TRUQAP, was approved by the FDA for the treatment of adult patients HR-positive, HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with one or more alterations in PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN gene(s) in combination with . This approval is based on favorable results obtained from the CAPItello-291 trial, where the combination of capivasertib and  reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 50% versus  alone.

**Indications:**

- Hormone Receptor-positive, HER2-negative, Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer

## Rucaparib

**Description:**

Rucaparib is an anticancer drug and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. PARP is an enzyme that plays an essential role in DNA repair. Rucaparib is proposed to work in several PARP-dependent and PARP-independent mechanisms of action; however, it causes a unique effect of synthetic lethality. By targeting the genetically-mutated cancer cells that lack a DNA repair mechanism, rucaparib causes cancer cell death and reduces tumour growth. Rucaparib was granted FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation in April 2015  and accelerated approval in December 2016. The drug was later approved by the European Commission in May 2018. It is currently used to treat recurrent ovarian and prostate cancer in adults.

## Mirvetuximab soravtansine

**Description:**

Mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx (IMGN853) is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) formed by a monoclonal antibody (M9346A) that targets folate receptor alpha (FRα), covalently joined by a cleavable disulfide linker to the genotoxic compound DM4 (also known as soravtansine or ravtansine). DM4 is conjugated to the antibody with a drug-to-antibody ratio of 3.5:1.  The antibody component of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx binds to FRα, a receptor overexpressed on the surface of epithelial tumor cells, characteristic of ovarian, endometrial, triple-negative breast and non-small-cell lung cancers. After an ADC/receptor complex is formed, mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx is internalized, and DM4 is released inside the cell. DM4 leads to cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis and is also able to diffuse into neighboring cells and induce further cell death. On November 2022, the FDA granted accelerated approval to mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx for the treatment of adult patients with FRα–positive, platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who have received 1-3 prior systemic treatment regimens. This decision was supported by findings from the phase 3 SORAYA trial (NCT04296890).

**Indications:**

- Platinum Resistant Primary Peritoneal Cancer, Platinum-resistant Epithelial Ovarian Cancer, Platinum drug resistant Fallopian tube cancer

**Targets:**

- HOXB2

## Mogamulizumab

**Description:**

Mogamulizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) for the treatment of Mycosis Fungoides (MF) and Sézary Syndrome (SS), the most common subtypes of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas occur when certain white blood cells, called T cells, become cancerous; these cancers typically affect the skin, causing various types of skin lesions. On August 8 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved mogamulizumab injection (also known as _Poteligeo_) for intravenous use for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mycosis fungoides (MF) or Sézary syndrome (SS) after at least one prior systemic therapy. It was approved for the same indications in Canada in June 2022. Mogamulizumab is derived from Kyowa Hakko Kirin's POTELLIGENT (®) technology, which produces antibodies with enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity. Approval in Japan was granted on April 30 2012 by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare for patients with relapsed or refractory CCR4-positive adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma.

**Indications:**

- Refractory Mycosis Fungoides/Sezary Syndrome
- Relapsed Mycosis Fungoides/Sezary Syndrome

**Targets:**

## Asciminib

**Description:**

Asciminib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) used in the treatment of chronic-phase Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (Ph+ CML). More specifically, it is an inhibitor of the ABL1 kinase activity of the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein which serves as a driver of CML proliferation in most patients with the disease. It has also shown benefit in Ph+ CML with the T315I mutation, which produces a mutant BCR-ABL1 which is typically treatment-resistant as compared to wild-type BCR-ABL1. Existing inhibitors of ABL compete at the ATP binding sites of these proteins and can be classified into those that target the active conformation of the kinase domain (, ) and those that target the inactive kinase domain (, , ). Asciminib is unique in that it acts as an allosteric inhibitor, binding at the myristoyl pocket of the BCR-ABL1 protein and locking it into an inactive conformation. Asciminib received FDA approval on October 29, 2021 (Scemblix, Novartis AG).

**Indications:**

- Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase

**Targets:**

- ABL1
- BCR

## Lurbinectedin

**Description:**

Lurbinectedin is a DNA alkylating agent that has been investigated in the treatment of a variety of cancers, including mesothelioma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), breast cancer, and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). It is a derivative of the marine-derived agent ecteinascidin (), an anticancer agent found in extracts of the tunicate _Ecteinascidia turbinata_, with the primary difference being the substitution of the tetrahydroisoquinoline with a tetrahydro β‐carboline that results in increased antitumour activity of lurbinectedin as compared to its predecessor. On June 15, 2020, the FDA granted accelerated approval and orphan drug designation to lurbinectedin for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic SCLC who have experienced disease progression despite therapy with platinum-based agents. This accelerated approval is based on the rate and duration of therapeutic response observed in ongoing clinical trials and is contingent on the verification of these results in confirmatory trials.

## Moxetumomab pasudotox

**Description:**

CD22 is a lineage-restricted B-cell antigen that is expressed solely in on B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hairy cell leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemiathe and Burkitt's lymphoma. The predecessor of Moxetumab pasudotox (MxP), named BL22, was first created based on the antibody RFB4 which specifically binds to CD22. This antibody was used to generate a recombinant immunotoxin in which a stabilized Fv segment by a disulfide bond is fused to the _Pseudomonas_ exotoxin A (PE38) which does not have the cell-binding portion.  MxP appears as an improved form of BL22 by the mutation of the Fv region and the antibody phage-displayed. As well the residues SSY in the heavy chain are mutated to THW. It was developed by Astra Zeneca and FDA approved on September 13, 2018, after being granted the status of Fast Track, Priority Review and Orphan Drug designations.

**Indications:**

- Relapsed/Refractory Hairy Cell Leukemia

**Targets:**

- CD22
- GNG4
- EEF2

## Quizartinib

**Description:**

Quizartinib is an oral and potent fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitor and it is the first drug developed specifically targeting FLT3, as other agents with FLT3 inhibition activities were investigated with other targets in mind. Additionally, quizartinib also demonstrates inhibitory activity toward FLT3 with internal tandem duplication (ITD), although with a 10-fold lower affinity compared to wild-type FLT3. FLT3-ITD mutation is present in 75% of FLT3-mutated AML, leading to constitutively active FLT3 and thus poorer overall survival and higher risk of relapse. Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated quizartinib's efficacy in relapsed/refractory FLT3-ITD mutant AML. Therefore, quizartinib is proven to be a beneficial addition to the current AML treatment regimen, although serious side effects such as QT prolongation necessitates further research to optimize quizartinib's addition to AML standard of care. Quizartinib was approved by the FDA in July 2023 and developed under the brand name VANFLYTA by Daiichi Sankyo. The FDA approval was based on positive results from the QuANTUM-First trial for FLT3-ITD positive AML, where quizartinib combined with standard cytarabine and anthracycline induction and standard cytarabine consolidation, followed by a maintenance monotherapy resulted in a 22% reduction in the risk of death.

## Mifamurtide

**Description:**

Mifamurtide is an immunomodulator with antitumor activity via activation of macrophages and monocytes. Also called L-MTP-PE, mifamurtide may be a liposomal form of of the active ingredient MTP-PE, which is a synthetic, less pyrogenic, and longer-acting derivative of muramyl dipeptide (MDP). MDP is a motif present in all gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial walls that is recognized by different signalling molecules and activators such as nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) and toll-like receptors present in macrophages and monocytes. The overall result of MDP recognition leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines and promotion of bactericidal and tumoricidal effects . As a liposomal formulation, mifamurtide demonstrates an enhanced tumoricidal effect and improved safety profile . Mifamurtide is marketed in Europe as Mepact for intravenous infusion. It is administered as an adjuvant therapy to postoperative combination chemotherapy in pediatric, adolescent or adult patients with high-grade, resectable, non-metastatic osteosarcoma after macroscopically complete surgical resection. In the US, it is currently under investigation that holds orphan drug status for the treatment of osteosarcoma . Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone tumor that usually arises in the metaphyses of long bone in children and adolescents . The standard therapy for osteosarcoma is comprised of macroscopic surgical resection and multi-agent chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin, cisplatin, high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue, and ifosfamide . While about 90% of patients with newly diagnosed osteosarcoma may achieve complete remission from first-line therapies, the prognosis is still poor for patients with non-metastatic osteosarcoma with lower 5-year event-free survival. In a large, randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase III trial, the treatment of mifamurtide in conjunction with three- or four-drug combination chemotherapy (doxorubicin, cisplatin, and high-dose methotrexate with, or without, ifosfamide) was associated with significant improvement in survival rates and good tolerance . The adverse events (AEs) associated with mifamurtide were generally mild to moderate in severity .

**Indications:**

- High-grade, nonmetastatic Osteosarcoma
- Resectable, nonmetastatic Osteosarcoma

**Targets:**

- NOD2

## Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate

**Description:**

A 177Lu-labeled somatostatin analog peptide, Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate belongs to an emerging form of treatments called Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT), which involves targeting tumours with molecules carrying radioactive particles that bind to specific receptors expressed by the tumour. Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate may also be referred to as 177Lu-DOTA-Tyr3-octreotate. Compared to the alternative somatostatin analogue DOTA-Tyr3-octreotide (dotatoc), Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate displays higher uptake of radioactivity in tumors and better residence times . In terms of biodistribution, Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate demonstrated a lower whole-body retention, indicating potentially lower risk for bone marrow toxicity . The presence of a radioligand allows monitoring of treatment response post therapy and prior to next fraction of the dose delivery which may be clinically beneficial in estimating the intensity of lesion uptakes or deciding the dose for subsequent administrations . Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate was approved by the FDA as Lutathera in January 2018 for intravenous injection. It is a first radiopharmaceutical agent to be approved for gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) and is indicated for adult patients with somatostatin receptor-positive GEP-NETs . Targeting pancreas and other parts of the gastrointestinal tract such as the intestines and colon, neuroendocrine tumors may commonly metastasize to metastasize to the mesentery, peritoneum, and liver . Patients with GEP-NETs have limited second-line treatment options after the metastasis of tumors and inadequate therapeutic response from first-line therapies. In a clinical trial involving patients with advanced somatostatin receptor-positive GEP-NET, the treatment of Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate in combination with octreotide resulted in longer progression-free survival compared to patients receiving octreotide alone and there was evidence of an overall survival benefit .

**Indications:**

- Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors

**Targets:**

## Ivosidenib

**Description:**

Ivosidenib is a first-in-class isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) inhibitor. IDH1 is an enzyme that is often mutated and overexpressed in some cancers, leading to aberrant cell growth and proliferation. Ivosidenib inhibits mutated IDH1, blocking the enzymatic activity and further differentiation of cancer cells. Ivosidenib was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in July 2018 for the treatment of relapsed of refractory acute myeloid leukemia in adults. It is currently approved to also treat newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia in older adults in combination  or as monotherapy, as well as locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma and relapsed or refractory myelodysplastic syndromes in adults. The drug is only effective in patients with a susceptible IDH1 mutation. In February 2023, the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion of ivosidenib and recommended it be granted marketing authorization for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia and cholangiocarcinoma. It was fully approved by the EMA in May 2023.

## Larotrectinib

**Description:**

Larotrectinib is an orally administered inhibitor of tropomyosin receptor kinase (Trk), a receptor tyrosine kinase activated by neurotrophins which is mutated in a variety of cancer cell types and plays an important role in tumor cell growth and survival. Upon administration, larotrectinib binds to Trk, thereby preventing neurotrophin-Trk interaction and Trk activation, which results in both the induction of cellular apoptosis and the inhibition of cell growth in tumors that overexpress Trk. Larotrectinib was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in November 2018 for the treatment of Trk-positive solid tumors. It was notable for being the second tissue-agnostic chemotherapy ever approved by the FDA.

**Indications:**

## Relatlimab

**Description:**

Relatlimab is a human IgG4 monoclonal antibody and novel immune checkpoint inhibitor that targets lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3). It was the first commercially developed anti-LAG-3 antibody, entering clinical trials in 2013, and has garnered interest in the treatment of a variety of cancers, including leukemia and melanoma. As immune checkpoint inhibitors have limited efficacy when used alone, drugs like relatlimab have been trialed in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors - for example, PD-1 inhibitors like  or CTLA-4 inhibitors like  - to enhance their efficacy. Relatlimab received FDA approval in March 2022, alongside the PD-1 inhibitor  in the combination product Opdualag (Bristol-Myers Squibb), for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma. It was the first anti-LAG-3 antibody to demonstrate benefit in a Phase 3 study, as well as the first to receive FDA approval. Opdualag was subsequently approved in the European Union in July 2022 and in Canada in September 2023.

## Margetuximab

**Description:**

The HER2 oncoprotein, the product of the human _ERBB2_/mouse _neu_ genes, is a member of the HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases that includes the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Of the various subtypes of breast cancer, HER2-positive breast cancer is characterized by _ERBB2_ overexpression, a higher grade, a more aggressive phenotype, and a worse prognosis compared to HER2-negative cancer. The introduction of  improved patient outcomes in HER2-positive breast cancer, but notably depended substantially on polymorphisms in the FcγRIIIA/CD16A receptor, whereby low affinity 158F CD16A variants are associated with shorter progression-free survival and worse patient outcomes. Margetuximab (formerly MGAH22) is an Fc-engineered human/mouse chimeric anti-HER2 IgG1κ monoclonal antibody derived from the same mouse 4D5 clone that  is derived from and is produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) culture. Margetuximab binds to the same epitope on the HER2 extracellular domain and induces the same effects as . However, due to its modified Fc region, margetuximab binds with higher affinity to both CD16A variants and exhibits weaker binding to the inhibitory CD32B Fc receptor, resulting in more efficient antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and increased efficacy compared to . Margextuximab was granted FDA approval on December 16, 2020, and is currently marketed under the trademark MARGENZA™ by MacroGenics, Inc.

**Indications:**

- HER2-positive Metastatic Breast Cancer

## Umbralisib

**Description:**

Marginal zone lymphoma is a rare, slowly progressing type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma initially treated with  (an anti-CD20 drug), either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Unfortunately, many patients experience a relapse or develop resistance to these drugs. Treatment options then become limited, and alternate treatments for the lymphoma are required to control disease progression. Follicular lymphoma is also treated with rituximab and other chemotherapeutic agents, but may show similar progression. On February 5, 2021, the Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval to umbralisib, a kinase inhibitor for PI3K-delta and casein kinase CK1-epsilon, based on promising results from clinical trials. It was marketed as Ukoniq by TG Therapeutics and has been approved for the treatment of relapsing and refractory marginal cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma in adults. Umbralisib inhibits casein kinase, a primary regulator of protein translation, kinase-1ε, distinguishing it from other lymphoma treatments. While it initially offered a promising therapy for patients experiencing relapsing or refractory disease, umbralisib was withdrawn from the market due to safety concerns as the drug was associated with a possible increased risk of death outweighing the benefits.

**Indications:**

- B-cell Follicular Lymphoma
- Marginal Zone Lymphoma (MZL)

**Targets:**

- PIK3CD
- PIK3CG
- ELF2

## Zanubrutinib

**Description:**

Zanubrutinib is a novel Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor used for the treatment of adult patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy. Mantle cell lymphoma is an aggressive mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma associated with early relapse, poor clinical outcomes, and long-term survival. BTK is an enzyme that plays a role in oncogenic signalling pathways, promoting the survival and proliferation of malignant B cells. Compared to the first-generation BTK inhibitor , zanubrutinib displays higher potency and selectivity for BTK with fewer off-target effects. Due to this enhanced selectivity towards BTK, zanubrutinib belongs to the second-generation BTK inhibitor drug group that also includes , which was approved by the FDA in 2017. Zanubrutinib was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in November 2019 based on clinical trial results that demonstrated an 84% overall response rate from zanubrutinib therapy in patients with MCL, which measures the proportion of patients in a trial whose tumour is entirely or partially destroyed by a drug. It is currently marketed under the trade name BRUKINSA™ and is available as oral capsules. In August 2021, the FDA granted accelerated approval to zanubrutinib for the treatment of adults with Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia. This indication is valid in the US, Europe, and Canada. In September 2021, zanubrutinib was granted another accelerated approval for the treatment of relapsed or refractory marginal zone lymphoma who have received at least one anti-CD20-based regimen. In October 2022, the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended zanubrutinib be granted marketing authorization for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

## Toripalimab

**Description:**

The proliferation of some cancers can be attributed, at least in part, to the suppression of host tumor surveillance. One mechanism by which this occurs is through the overexpression of programmed cell death ligand (PD-L1) - the binding of PD-L1 (and PD-L2) to its target receptor (PD-1) results in the inhibition of T-cell proliferation and cytokine production, and thus its overexpression can inhibit T-cell-mediated immune surveillance of tumors.   Toripalimab is a selective, recombinant, humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody targeted against the PD-1 receptor. It was first approved in China in December 2018 for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma in previously treated patients. Toripalimab was granted FDA approval in October 2023 for the treatment of select patients with nasopharyngeal carcinomas.

**Indications:**

- Metastatic and Recurrent Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma

**Targets:**

- GM2A

## Tafasitamab

**Description:**

Tafasitamab is a humanized, CD19-directed cytolytic monoclonal antibody intended for the treatment of B-cell malignancies. It is produced using recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and contains an IgG1/2 hybrid Fc-domain which has been modified with 2 amino acid substitutions to enhance its cytotoxicity relative to non-engineered anti-CD19 antibodies. The CD19 surface protein is highly expressed on the surface of B-cells, where it appears to play a role in enhancing B-cell receptor signaling. Its relative ubiquity across different stages of B-cell development, including pre-B and mature B-lymphocytes, as well as its presence in several B-cell malignancies (e.g. chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)) has made it a desirable target in the treatment these B-cell malignancies. Tafasatimab is designed to bind to and block the activity of the CD19 surface antigen, which ultimately results in the lysis of B-cells (both healthy and malignant). Having previously received Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track, and Orphan designations from the FDA, tafasatimab-cxix (Monjuvi®) received an accelerated approval on July 31st, 2020, for the treatment of relapsed or refractory DLBCL in adult patients who cannot receive autologous stem cell transplants. It must be used in combination with , as this combination results in greater efficacy as compared to either agent alone.

**Indications:**

- Refractory Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma NOS
- Relapsed Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma NOS

**Targets:**

- GMFB
- TNFRSF8
- CD19

## Pemigatinib

**Description:**

Pemigatinib is a small molecule kinase inhibitor with antitumour activity. It works by inhibiting fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), which are receptor tyrosine kinases that activate signalling pathways in tumour cells. FGFRs gained attention as potential therapeutic targets in selected cancers, as FGFR gene alterations were observed in a wide variety of cancers including those of the urinary bladder, breast, ovary, prostate, endometrium, lung, and stomach. Deregulated FGFR signalling pathway can lead the development of oncogenes and tumour-promoting physiological processes, such as cancer cell proliferation, enhanced angiogenesis, and evasion of cell death. In April 2020, pemigatinib was approved by the FDA for the treatment of unresectable locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma in previously treated adult patients with a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene fusion or other rearrangements as detected by an FDA-approved test. Cholangiocarcinoma is the most common primary malignancy affecting the biliary tract and the second most common primary hepatic malignancy. This malignancy accounts for 15% to 20% of primary hepatobiliary malignancies, which account for 13% of overall cancer-related global mortality. With increasing research on the pathogenesis of cholangiocarcinoma and potential therapeutic targets for anticancer drug treatment, recent studies show that up to 45% of patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma exhibited gene rearrangements resulting in oncogenic fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGFR2) fusion proteins. The FDA-approved indication for pemigatinib was granted under accelerated approval based on the overall response rate and duration of response in pre-marketing clinical trials. Pemigatinib is marketed under the brand name Pemazyre, and it is available as oral tablets.

**Indications:**

- Unresectable, locally advanced Cholangiocarcinomas
- Unresectable, metastatic Cholangiocarcinomas

**Targets:**

- FGFR3
- FGFR2
- DPYSL3
- DR1
- DPYSL2
- FGFR1

## Tepotinib

**Description:**

Tepotinib is a MET tyrosine kinase inhibitor intended to treat a variety of MET-overexpressing solid tumors. It was originally developed in partnership between EMD Serono and the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in 2009 and has since been investigated in the treatment of neuroblastoma, gastric cancers, non-small cell lung cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. MET is a desirable target in the treatment of certain solid tumors as it appears to play a critical role, both directly and indirectly, in the growth and proliferation of tumors in which it is overexpressed and/or mutated. Tepotinib was first approved in Japan in March 2020 for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) with _MET_ alterations, and was subsequently granted accelerated approval by the US FDA in February 2021, under the brand name Tepmetko, for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic NSCLC and _MET_ exon 14 skipping alterations. It is the first oral MET-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor to allow for once-daily dosing, an advantage that may aid in easing the pill burden often associated with chemotherapeutic regimens. In February 2022, tepotinib was approved for use in Europe.

**Indications:**

- Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer

**Targets:**

- MET
- EGFR
- DRD4

## Tebentafusp

**Description:**

Tebentafusp is a gp100 peptide-HLA-directed CD3 T cell engager. It is a bispecific, fusion protein and first-in-class drug of immune-mobilizing monoclonal T cell receptors against cancer (ImmTACs), a recently developed cancer immunotherapy with a novel mechanism of action. ImmTACs bind to target cancer cells that express a specific antigen of interest and recruit cytotoxic T cells to lyse the cells, such as melanocytes. Uveal melanoma is a rare ocular tumour with often poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Even after surgical ablation or removal of the ocular tumour, almost 50% of patients with uveal melanoma develop metastatic disease. On January 26, 2022, tebentafusp was first approved by the FDA for the treatment of HLA-A*02:01-positive adults with unresectable or metastatic uveal melanoma. This approval marks the first bispecific T cell engager to be approved by the FDA to treat a solid tumour and being the first and only therapy for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic uveal melanoma to be approved by the FDA. Tebentafusp was subsequently approved for the same indication in the EU in April 2022.

**Indications:**

- Metastatic Uveal Melanoma (UM), Unresectable Uveal Melanoma

**Targets:**

- PMEL
- TRBV20OR9-2

## Mosunetuzumab

**Description:**

Mosunetuzumab is a humanized anti-CD20/CD3 bispecific antibody. It can recognize and bind two different targets simultaneously, CD20 on cancer B-cells and CD3 on T-cells, allowing it to redirect T-cell cytotoxic activity to cancer cells. The standard of care for patients with B-cell lymphoma includes an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, such as , in combination with chemotherapy. However, patients with certain types of B-cell lymphoma, such as follicular lymphoma (FL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or aggressive B-cell lymphoma, have a high probability of relapse or recurrence after treatment. Mosunetuzumab has the potential to circumvent resistance to  in patients with follicular lymphoma, and unlike CAR-T therapies such as  and , it is an “off-the-shelf” alternative, readily available to patients. In June 2022, the European Medicines Agency approved mosunetuzumab for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) FL who have received at least two prior systemic therapies. In January 2023, the use of mosunetuzumab was approved by the FDA under accelerated approval based on response rate.

**Indications:**

- Relapsed follicular lymphoma, Refractory follicular lymphoma

## Belzutifan

**Description:**

Belzutifan is an inhibitor of hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF-2α) used in the treatment of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease-associated cancers. The HIF-2α protein was first identified in the 1990s by researchers at UT Southwestern Medical Center as a key player in the growth of certain cancers. Initially considered to be undruggable, a binding pocket was eventually discovered in the HIF-2α molecule which allowed for compounds to bind and inhibit these proteins. This discovery led to the initial development of belzutifan (at the time called PT2977), which was further developed by a spin-off company named Peloton Pharmaceuticals (which itself was eventually acquired by Merck in 2019). Belzutifan inhibits the complexation of HIF-2α with another transcription factor, HIF-1β, a necessary step in its activation - by preventing the formation of this complex, belzutifan can slow or stop the growth of VHL-associated tumors. Belzutifan received FDA approval for the treatment of select VHL-associated cancers on August 13, 2021.

**Indications:**

- Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma

**Targets:**

- HMGB2

## Adagrasib

**Description:**

Adagrasib (MRTX849) is an oral, small-molecule KRAS inhibitor developed by Mirati Therapeutics. KRAS mutations are highly common in cancer and account for approximately 85% of all RAS family mutations. However, the development of KRAS inhibitors has been challenging due to their high affinity for guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and guanosine diphosphate (GDP), as well as the lack of a clear binding pocket. Adagrasib targets KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>, one of the most common KRAS mutations, at the cysteine 12 residue and inhibits KRAS-dependent signalling. In a phase I/IB clinical study that included patients with KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-mutated advanced solid tumors (NCT03785249), adagrasib exhibited anti-tumor activity. The phase II of the same study showed that in patients with KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), adagrasib was efficient without new safety signals. In February 2022, the FDA accepted a new drug application (NDA) for adagrasib for the treatment of patients with previously treated KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>–positive NSCLC. In December 2022, the FDA granted accelerated approval to adagrasib for the treatment of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-mutated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have received at least one prior systemic therapy. Adagrasib joins  as another KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibitor approved by the FDA.

**Indications:**

- Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer

**Targets:**

- KRAS
- GPM6B

## Dostarlimab

**Description:**

Dostarlimab is an IgG<sub>4</sub> humanized monoclonal antibody targeted against the human programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1). PD-1 receptors are found on T-cells and, when activated, serve to inhibit immune responses - some cancers leverage this system by overexpressing PD-1 ligands, thereby effectively inhibiting the anti-tumor immune response that would typically attempt to destroy the cancerous cells. Agents acting on the PD-1 pathway, such as  and , facilitate endogenous immune-mediated anti-tumor activity and may therefore be used to treat a wide variety of cancers, including those of the skin, lung, kidneys, and liver.  In April 2021, dostarlimab was granted accelerated approval by the FDA - as GlaxoSmithKline's dostarlimab-gxly (Jemperli) - for the treatment of adult patients with recurrent or advanced mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) endometrial cancer experiencing disease progression despite treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens. A companion diagnostic device - the VENTANA MMR RxDx Panel - was also approved alongside this indication to select appropriate patients for treatment. This indication was granted full FDA approval on February 10, 2023. Dostarlimab-gxly was granted second accelerated approval for the treatment of solid tumours in the same month. Dostarlimab is currently under investigation for the treatment of rectal cancers with mismatch repair deficiency. A prospective phase II study in patients with mismatch repair-deficient locally advanced rectal cancer resulted in all twelve patients exhibiting a complete clinical response.

**Indications:**

- Adults with mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer that has progressed on or following prior treatment with a platinum-containing regimen

**Targets:**

- POLD1
- PDCD1

## Selpercatinib

**Description:**

Selpercatinib is a kinase inhibitor with enhanced specificity for RET tyrosine kinase receptors (RTKs) over other RTK classes. Enhanced RET (Rearranged during transfection) oncogene expression is a hallmark of many cancers. Although multikinase inhibitors, including , , , , and , have shown efficacy in RET-driven cancers, their lack of specificity is generally associated with substantial toxicity. Selpercatinib (LOXO-292) and pralsetinib (BLU-667) represent the first generation of specific RET RTK inhibitors for the treatment of RET-driven cancers. Although selpercatinib is currently still under investigation in clinical trial NCT04211337, it was granted accelerated FDA approval on May 8, 2020, for specific RET-driven cancer indications. It is currently marketed under the brand name RETEVMO™ by Loxo Oncology Inc. Selpercatinib is also approved by the European Commission.

## Brexucabtagene autoleucel

**Description:**

Mantle cell lymphoma is a heterogeneous sub-category of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that can be classified as either an aggressive nodal or an indolent leukemic non-nodal variant. Despite the introduction of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors such as  and , the prognosis for MCL patients remains poor and those that relapse following BTK inhibitor therapy have few treatment options. More recently, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies have been developed that modify a patient's own T cells using viral transduction to bind to and destroy cancerous cells. These therapies differ in manufacturing methodology, viral vector, chimeric antigen choice, and the internal co-stimulatory domains of the chimeric antigen. Similar to , brexucabtagene autoleucel employs a murine anti-CD19 single-chain variable fragment (scFv) linked to internal CD28- and CD3ζ-derived co-stimulatory domains. However, the preparation of brexucabtagene autoleucel, previously referred to as KTE-X19, uses a method of T cell enrichment that decreases the prevalence of CD19-expressing tumour cells in the CAR T cell preparation. Brexucabtagene autoleucel was granted accelerated approval for the treatment of relapsed and refractory MCL by the FDA on July 24, 2020, and is currently available through Kite Pharma Inc. under the tradename TECARTUS.

**Indications:**

- Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma
- Relapsed Mantle Cell Lymphoma

**Targets:**

- CD19

## Naxitamab

**Description:**

Naxitamab (humanized 3F8, hu3F8) is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against the oncofetal differentiation antigen GD2 disialoganglioside. Normally expressed during fetal development and in mature neurons, pain fibers, and skin cells, GD2 constitutes a highly efficient target in the treatment of neuroblastoma - it is widely expressed across and within neuroblastomas (and other neuroectodermal tumors), and is rarely subject to antigen loss. The first anti-GD2-monoclonal IgG antibody to be approved by the FDA for the treatment of neuroblastoma was  under the brand name Unituxin in 2015. One stark disadvantage of this therapy is the requirement for concurrent use of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and 13-cis-retinoic acid (RA). Naxitamab-gqgk (Danyelza) was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in November 2020 for the treatment of high-risk relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma of the bone or bone marrow. This approval requires naxitamab to be co-administered only with GM-CSF, a factor known to enhance the granulocyte-mediated antibody-dependent cytotoxicity of anti-GD2 therapies, making the administration of naxitamab therapy markedly simpler than that of its predecessor.

**Indications:**

- High risk, refractory Neuroblastomas of the bone or bone marrow
- High risk, relapsed Neuroblastomas of the bone or bone marrow

## Loncastuximab tesirine

**Description:**

Relapsed and refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) are a therapeutic challenge for patients who have undergone prior systemic therapies with limited success. Prognosis is poor and more effective therapies are needed to treat relapsed/refractory cases and improve survival. On April 23 2021, the Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval for the antibody-drug conjugate, loncastuximab tesirine-lpyl, also known as Zynlonta. Zylonta also received approval in the EU on December 22, 2022.

## Olutasidenib

**Description:**

Olutasidenib (FT-2102) is a selective and potent isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) inhibitor approved by the FDA in December 2022. It is indicated for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in patients with a susceptible IDH1 mutation as determined by an FDA-approved test. IDH1 mutations are common in different types of cancer, such as gliomas, AML, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, chondrosarcoma, and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and they lead to an increase in 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), a metabolite that participates in tumerogenesis. Olutasidenib inhibits the mutated IDH1 specifically, and provides a therapeutic benefit in IDH1-mutated cancers. Other IDH1 inhibitors, such as , have also been approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML. Olutasidenib is orally bioavailable and capable of penetrating the blood-brain barrier, and is also being evaluated for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), as well as solid tumors and gliomas (NCT03684811).

**Indications:**

- Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), Relapsed Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML)

## Glofitamab

**Description:**

Glofitamab is a full-length bispecific monoclonal antibody with affinity for both CD20 and CD3 surface antigens found on B- and T-cells, respectively. It has a 2:1 configuration, with bivalency towards CD20 and monovalency towards CD3, and works by recruiting T-cells directly to the surface of cancerous B-cells. Glofitamab was approved by Health Canada in March 2023 for the treatment of certain patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), becoming the first CD20/CD3 bispecific monoclonal antibody approved for DLBCL. The most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, DLBCL is relatively sensitive to chemotherapy and generally responsive to first-line treatment regimens like CHOP (, , , ) - despite this, as many as 40% of patients will experience relapsed or refractory disease. In the context of relapsed or refractory DLBCL, glofitamab provides an alternative treatment option for patients having failed other systemic therapies or for whom targeted therapies - such as CAR-T cell therapy - are inappropriate. In June 2023, the FDA approved the use of glofitamab for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL not otherwise specified or large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) arising from follicular lymphoma, after two or more lines of systemic therapy under accelerated approval based on response rate and durability of response.  Glofitamab was granted conditional marketing authorization in July 2023 by the EMA for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy. This approval is based on the positive results obtained from the phase I/II NP30179 study, where 35.2% of study participants achieved a complete response.

**Indications:**

- Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), Large B Cell Lymphoma, Primary Mediastinal (Thymic) Large B Cell Lymphoma (PMBCL), Refractory Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma, Not Otherwise Specified, Relapsed Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), Relapsed Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma, Not Otherwise Specified

## Mobocertinib

**Description:**

Mobocertinib is a kinase inhibitor targeted against human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). It is used specifically in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) caused by exon 20 insertion mutations in the _EGFR_ gene, which are typically associated with a poorer prognosis (as compared to  classical  _EGFR_ mutants causing NSCLC) and are associated with resistance to standard targeted EGFR inhibitors. Mobocertinib appears to be an effective means of treating this otherwise treatment-resistant NSCLC, exerting an inhibitory effect on _EGFR_ exon 20 insertion mutant variants at concentrations 1.5- to 10-fold lower than those required to inhibit wild-type EGFR. Mobocertinib, under the brand name Exkivity (Takeda Pharmaceuticals Inc.), was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in September 2021 for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC in patients with _EGFR_ exon 20 insertion mutations who have failed previous therapies.

**Indications:**

- Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer

**Targets:**

- EGFR

## Melphalan flufenamide

**Description:**

Melphalan flufenamide, also known as melflufen or J1, is a prodrug of . Melphalan flufenamide is more readily uptaken by cells than melphalan, and is cleaved to the active metabolite by aminopeptidases. _In vitro_ models show that melphalan is 10 to hundreds of times more potent than melphalan. The increased potency makes melphalan flufenamide a treatment option for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have attempted at least 4 lines of therapy already. Melphalan flufenamide was granted FDA approval on 26 February 2021.. It has since been withdrawn from the market in the wake of the phase 3 OCEAN trial which showed a decrease in overall survival in comparison to standard treatment with  and  despite superior progression-free survival.

## Epcoritamab

**Description:**

Epcoritamab is an IgG1-bispecific antibody that simultaneously binds to CD3 on T-cells and CD20 on B-cells. Epcoritamab promotes the activation and expansion of T-cells and, by being able to bind to both CD20 and CD3, it leads to the T-cell–mediated killing of CD20+ malignant B cells. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive type of cancer commonly treated with several cycles of , , , , and . Although this regimen is effective in up to 60% of patients, patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL have poor outcomes. The use of epcoritamab in this group of patients has high response rates, durable complete responses and manageable adverse events with few discontinuations. The use of epcoritamab may lead to cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome. It is administered subcutaneously and is currently being evaluated as a monotherapy and in combination for the treatment of a variety of hematologic malignancies. In May 2023, epcoritamab was approved by the FDA under accelerated approval for the treatment of relapsed or refractory DLBCL. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s). In September 2023, epcoritamab was also approved in the EU for the same indication.

**Indications:**

- Refractory Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), Relapsed Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)

## Odronextamab

**Description:**

Odronextamab is a hinge-stabilized, fully human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-based CD20×CD3 bispecific antibody currently evaluated for the treatment of relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-Cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Preliminary studies have shown that in patients with R/R NHL, the use of odronextamab does not lead to the development of neurologic toxicity; however, it can lead to the development of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), a serious condition associated with the use of immunotherapy. In December 2020, the FDA placed a partial clinical hold and requested the drug developer, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, to amend clinical protocols to reduce the incidence of CRS. The partial clinical hold was later lifted in May 2021.  A phase I clinical study (NCT02290951) showed that in heavily pre-treated patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, odronextamab elicited a durable response with a manageable safety profile.

**Indications:**

- Relapsed/refractory B-Cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma

**Targets:**

- GATM

## Amivantamab

**Description:**

Amivantamab, also known as JNJ-61186372, is an anti-EGFR-MET bispecific antibody, derived from Chinese hamster ovary cells, approved for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion mutations, as detected by an FDA-approved test, whose disease has progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients with NSCLC often develop resistance to drugs that target EGFR and MET individually, so amivantamab was developed to attack both targets, reducing the chance of resistance developing. Amivantamab was found to be more effective than the EGFR inhibitor  or the MET inhibitor  _in vivo_. Patients with NSCLC with exon 20 insertion mutations in EGFR do not respond to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and were generally treated with platinum-based therapy. Amivantamab was granted FDA approval on 21 May 2021, followed by the approval by the EMA on 9 December 2021  and Health Canada on 30 March 2022.

**Indications:**

- Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer

**Targets:**

- DRD4
- DXO

## Tisotumab vedotin

**Description:**

Tisotumab vedotin is a tissue factor-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) comprised of an anti-tissue factor (TF) human IgG1-kappa antibody conjugated to monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), a microtubule-disrupting agent, via a protease-cleavable valine-citrulline linker. Each monoclonal antibody molecule carries an average of four MMAE molecules. Tisotumab vedotin is the first TF-directed ADC  that works by binding to TFs expressed on solid tumours. TF is a primary initiator of the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade  and plays a key role in tumor-associated angiogenesis, progression, and metastasis for tumor survival. TF is a novel target for cancers, as it is often overexpressed on solid tumours, including cervical cancer, and it is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Tisotumab vedotin targets TF-expressing cells to deliver MMAE to induce direct cytotoxicity and bystander killing of neighboring cells. On September 20, 2021, the FDA granted accelerated approval to tisotumab vedotin-tftv for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer in adults in whom the disease progressed during or after chemotherapy. This is the first and only approved antibody-drug conjugate for this therapeutic indication. The approval was based on tumour response and the durability of the response as demonstrated in InnovaTV 204 (NCT03438396): in this trial, the objective response rate was 24% and the median response duration was 8.3 months. Tisotumab vedotin-tftv is marketed under the trade name Tivdak as an intravenous injection. Tisotumab vedotin is currently under investigation as a treatment for other solid tumors, including ovarian, lung, colorectal, pancreatic, and head and neck cancers. It is also being investigated for the combination use with other chemotherapeutic agents for recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer.

## Ciltacabtagene autoleucel

**Description:**

Multiple myeloma is a malignancy involving the plasma cells of the bone marrow. It is a rare malignancy, with an estimated yearly incidence of 6.5 people per 100,000, and is variable in its presentation - some patients may remain entirely asymptomatic, while others may experience a range of symptoms including bone pain, hematologic abnormalities, and end-organ damage. There have been a number of treatments developed for multiple myeloma (e.g. ), although none are curative. B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is a transmembrane glycoprotein member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily 17 (TNFRSF17) which is used as a biomarker for multiple myeloma. While normally expressed on plasma blasts and plasma cells, BCMA is widely expressed on malignant plasma cells and most multiple myeloma cell lines, making it a choice target in the development of immunotherapies against multiple myeloma. Ciltacabtagene autoleucel (Carvykti, Jannsen Biotech Inc.) is a BCMA-directed genetically modified autologous T-cell immunotherapy. Patient T-cells are reprogrammed with a transgene encoding a specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) which features two BCMA-targeting single-domain antibodies. Re-infusion of these modified T-cells leads to the targeted elimination of malignant plasma cells, on which BCMA is highly expressed. Carvykti was first approved by the FDA in February 2022 for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in treatment-experienced patients.

**Indications:**

- Refractory Multiple Myeloma, Relapsed Multiple Myeloma

## Repotrectinib

**Description:**

Repotrectinib is a next-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) specifically designed to address resistance in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), specifically due to mutations in the ROS1 gene. ROS1 mutations are one of the defined oncogenic drives of NSCLC, and the solvent-front mutation ROS1 G2032R is responsible for 50 to 60% of -resistant cases. Repotrectinib possesses a compact macrocyclic structure that both limits adverse interactions with resistance mutation hotspots and targets mutations in the solvent-front region. Although resistance to multiple TKI has been reported, including , , , and , there has been no reported case of repotrectinib resistance. On November 15th, 2023, the FDA approved repotrectinib under the brand name Augtyro for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic ROS1-Positive NSCLC. This approval is based on favorable results from the TRIDENT-1 study, where the objective response rate was 79% in TKI-naive patients and 38% in TKI-pretreated patients respectively.

**Indications:**

- locally active or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer

## Nadofaragene firadenovec

**Description:**

Nadofaragene firadenovec (nadofaragene firadenovec-vncg) is a recombinant non-replicating adenovirus serotype 5 vector containing a transgene encoding human interferon alfa-2b (IFNα2b). It was approved by the FDA on December 2022 for the treatment of high-risk Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) with carcinoma _in situ_ (CIS) with or without papillary tumors. It is the first gene therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of bladder cancer. BCG-unresponsive NMIBC has a high recurrence and is notably difficult to treat. Most patients with this condition undergo radical cystectomy since other non-surgical treatments are far less effective. The use of nadofaragene firadenovec provides a therapeutic alternative to patients seeking non-surgical alternatives for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. Nadofaragene firadenovec is formulated with an excipient (Syn-3) that facilitates gene transfer across the urothelium and promotes the transduction of IFNα2b. The localized expression of this gene induces anti-tumor effects. Nadofaragene firadenovec also has a manageable adverse event profile. Compared to , a smaller proportion of patients experienced grade 3-4 adverse events (4% vs 12.7%).

**Indications:**

- High risk BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer

**Targets:**

- IFNA2

## Pirtobrutinib

**Description:**

Pirtobrutinib is a small molecule and a highly selective non-covalent inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK). Its high selectivity has been associated with lower discontinuation rates due to adverse events and a lower incidence of atrial fibrillation. Unlike BTK covalent inhibitors, such as , that bind to the cysteine 481 (Cys481) amino acid within the active site of BTK, the inhibitory activity of pirtobrutinib is maintained even in the presence of Cys481 mutations. Although the mechanisms of resistance to covalent BTK inhibitors have not been fully elucidated, it appears that the presence of Cys481 mutations is the most common reason for resistance to covalent BTK inhibitors. However, other mutations may confer resistance to non-covalent BTK inhibitors such as pirtobrutinib. In January 2023, the use of pirtobrutinib for the treatment of relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) after at least two lines of systemic therapy was approved under the FDA's Accelerated Approval pathway.

**Indications:**

- Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL), Relapsed Mantle Cell Lymphoma

**Targets:**

- BTK
- TP53
- EFNB2
- IGH
