# Description

The VRE for drug repurposing is a collaborative digital platform designed to streamline, support, and accelerate the research process for repurposing drugs to treat new diseases. It provides researchers with a set of tools and resources to facilitate data management, analysis, and collaboration, essential for identifying new therapeutic uses for existing drugs.
 
# Key Features

1. Data Integration: The VRE integrates information about various biomedical datasets, including drug databases, disease annotations, genomic information, and clinical trial data, to allow researchers to cross-reference and identify potential drug repurposing candidates.
2. Collaborative Research: Researchers across the SUDOE (Southwestern Europe) region can collaborate seamlessly, share findings, and work together on drug repurposing projects. Collaboration tools ensure that teams can communicate and exchange data efficiently.
3. Visualization and Reporting: Interactive dashboards and visualization tools allow researchers to track project progress and visualize relationships between various datasets, such as drug-disease associations and molecular interactions.
4. Training and Collaborative Learning: The VRE provides a platform for conducting seminars, webinars, and collaborative training sessions, enabling researchers to share knowledge, learn new techniques, and discuss advancements in drug repurposing, molecular docking, molecular dynamics, and other related fields.
 
# Target Users
- Researchers in computer-aided drug design and biomedicine across the RePo-SUDOE consortium.
- Machine learning and AI experts collaborating on drug discovery.
- Pharma and biotech companies looking to repurpose existing drugs for new therapeutic applications.
